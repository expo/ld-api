When your ammo goes below 50, the ammo icons will start to fade as a warning.

Well, the delivery is a complex process, it requires many pieces of a system to work seamlessly and of course perfection can never be achieved, because of a disaster, or a blackout, or a system crash, or some self-important smartarse thinking they're so important and cannot be replaced... Which is pretty naive because they can. Even by robots._\n\nYou control a loader robot. The task is simple: they ask you for a specific crate, you take it to them. Every crate is labeled, so you shouldn't be confused, but keep in mind that color matters too. Robot controls are pretty sensitive, may require some time to get used to. Use _arrows_ to move a robot and pick crates, _Z then arrow_ to put a crate in a chosen direction. You can stack crates into towers of 3. Crates will come fast, so try not to get stuck under the \"avalanche\".\n\nGood luck!\n\n***\n\nStill reading? 0_o\n\nWell, this game was supposed to be _way_ different. We started with physics and an artist and ended with turn-based movements and heavily based on assets from opengameart.org (guess what's not from there). Also, I didn't have enough time to playtest, so it may seem too difficult or too boring, or both. For me the fun starts on the second wave, but devs get used to their games quickly. Anyway, have fun and don't forget to share your score! =)","meta":{"author":[2490,54179],"cover":"///content/ab9/z/17ce8.png","grade-05-out":"1","grade-06-out":"1","grade-08-out":"1","link-01":"https://yngwarr.itch.io/quicksort","link-01-tag":"42336","link-02":"https://bitbucket.org/hardweird/ld42/src/master/","link-02-tag":"42332","link-02-name":"Source code"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/quicksort","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":0,"magic":{"cool":0,"feedback":0,"given":0,"grade":0,"smart":0}},"98115":{"id":98115,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":3885,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-12T19:47:27Z","created":"2018-07-10T06:34:48Z","modified":"2018-08-13T12:50:11Z","version":325563,"slug":"corrupted-space","name":"Corrupted Space","body":"![ldjam42.p8_16.gif](///raw/d2f/z/162d3.gif)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdG2PPPbrZM\n\n# :video_game: About :video_game: \n\nYou hate trash and bacterias.

Would have been great for last theme. Darn. Anyways, The whole of the gameplay takes place in a \"heap memory\" aka a grid of numbers. The goal of the game is to keep the memory from overflowing. To do this you must control the incoming byte, and swap data around in memory. To swap data around in memory you click on two active (not dark gray) numbers and they will swap. To deselect a digit, click outside the map. To resolve a group and remove it you right click on it. If the group size is 8 or greater it will score otherwise it will not. You will also increase the spawn rate of the bytes. Go as long as you can without overflowing the memory heap and score as many points as possible.\n\n## Notes\n\n### Overall\n\nThe game is decently finished but its very slow and imo not very interesting. It could certainly use some balancing I think, and it starts out way too slowly.\n\n### Mechanics\n\nWhen you complete a block and score points, the score multiplier increases and so does the rate. The rate changes by a constant amount for each score. However the score multiplier increases proportional to the number of digits removed.\n\n![screenshot.png](///raw/a4c/1/z/17301.png)","meta":{"author":[7242],"link-01-tag":"42332","grade-06-out":"1","grade-07-out":"1","grade-08-out":"1","cover":"///content/a4c/1/z/1725d.png","link-01":"https://github.com/GnarlyNarwhal/Ludum-Dare-42","link-02":"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XMUZP49DxGE8KB5OEtUxoEArjhHcM4Ju","link-02-tag":"42337"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/memory-1","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":13,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T20:34:30Z","grade":{"grade-01":7,"grade-02":7,"grade-03":7,"grade-04":7,"grade-05":7},"magic":{"grade":7,"given":6.875,"feedback":1,"smart":-3.9856781516424,"cool":142.72480642961}},"98271":{"id":98271,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":98270,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-13T21:04:06Z","created":"2018-07-12T03:13:20Z","modified":"2018-08-13T21:04:06Z","version":331308,"slug":"buffer-overflow","name":"Buffer Overflow","body":"In Buffer Overflow you control AV01, an antivirus tasked with protecting the MainFrame from virus attacks.

I included source code but wouldnt reccomend attemping to play the game as it doesnt have much gameplay. \n\nMy original idea was a sortof puzzle game where you play the role of an elevator operator/manager at a tall office building. Each round the boss at the top of the building would request certain types of people for a task/job then youd go up floor by floor from the bottom of the building, choosing what people to let on and off of a small elevator based on their skills and traits.

Your goal is to make them buy the fastest as possible to make them leave the shop, so your reputation will be preserved.\n\nThe game is made by me ;) My name is Mathieu and I participated to Ludum Dare 7 times in a row :)\nHope you will like the game and thank you for playing :)\n\nHere is a timelapse of the conception :\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=By5st5zao10","meta":{"author":[2200],"cover":"///content/898/z/16993.png","link-01":"https://kiup.itch.io/brand-new-shop","link-01-tag":"42337","link-02":"https://kiup.itch.io/brand-new-shop","link-02-tag":"42341","link-03":"https://kiup.itch.io/brand-new-shop","link-03-tag":"42332"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/brand-new-shop","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":15,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T19:32:10Z","grade":{"grade-01":22,"grade-02":22,"grade-03":21,"grade-04":22,"grade-05":22,"grade-06":22,"grade-07":19,"grade-08":21},"magic":{"grade":21.375,"given":24.25,"feedback":16,"smart":21.420167776433,"cool":109.09555669594}},"98347":{"id":98347,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":74831,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-12T21:17:05Z","created":"2018-07-13T05:02:33Z","modified":"2018-08-13T05:02:06Z","version":323510,"slug":"out-of-space","name":"Out of Space","body":"A simple runner about running out of space  \nTry to stay alive for as long as possible, avoid your own trail!​\n\n![Alt text](///content/f44/21/z/165c9.png?raw=true \"OOS\")\n___________________________________________\n\nMy compo submission to Ludum Dare 42 “Running out of space”\n\nAs soon as I've heard the theme an image flashed in my head - it's a game where you are in space, trying to run out of it while you are running out of space. That was the key to my design which I tried to keep following.\nLooking at my Trello, allow me to copypaste what I have written in \"Game Design\"\n\n============================================================================================\nPaper Plane is trying to run out of space before it runs out of space(yeah, literally, get the joke?)\nSpace is going to be like a tube but have a visual effect of an endless space.\nPressing left/right slides you across a tube(plane is on the inner side), may be simulated with rotation I guess.\nThere is an exit far away, on your way you should get speed up power ups.\nAfter you get to an exit, another plane spawns and runs after the last one.\nProblem is? First plane left a trail in its place, so every other following plane is literally running out of space while being in a space.\nFinal score is decided by overall traveled distance and time you managed to stay alive.\n\n============================================================================================\nI also remember my submission from LD41 where nobody managed to finished my game, so that was +1 drive to make an endless loop type of entertainment.\n\n**Used:  \nUnity 2018.2  \nZenject  \nDOTween  \nShader Graph  \nTrello  \nKrita**\n\n**What went right:**\n\n**Self-management**\n\n-> Using Trello I managed to pinpoint all the important points and milestones, what I need to cut down if things go nasty. It really took me 10 minutes to organize what I will refer every hour for the next two days.\n\n**Tools**\n\n-> Zenject took the pain of dependencies, every time I had to add something there was no \"damn how do I even...\" feeling\n\n-> Shader Graph allowed me to make a few cool effects easily\n\n**What went wrong:**\n\n**Scope**\n\n-> There is just so much I wanted to implement in a given time frame, and yet here I am. Contentwise game is miserable: no music, no models, no testing performed. It's all programmed, except for starry sky texture made in Krita\n\n**Tools**\n\n-> WebGL build is killing me, I remember having a bunch of problems with it last time\nThis time it took me almost 4 hours to guess what was wrong\nMaybe I will see in upcoming days if I can do anything about WebGL build, in the meantime I upload Win and Linux versions\nAlso some shader problems, halfway through I was able to switch texture on my skybox shader, but at some point in time it stopped working(noticed the bug too late)\n\n===========================================================================================\n\nAll in all, I feel like this is a real improvement over what I managed to make for LD41.\nCan't wait to see what I will pull out for LD43!","meta":{"author":[74831],"grade-06-out":"1","grade-07-out":"1","cover":"///content/f44/21/z/165c9.png","link-01":"https://github.com/metamorphling/LD42","link-01-tag":"50","link-01-name":"github","link-02":"https://metamorphling.itch.io/out-of-space","link-02-tag":"42337","link-03":"https://metamorphling.itch.io/out-of-space","link-03-tag":"42336"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/out-of-space","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":1,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T19:12:39Z","grade":{"grade-01":1,"grade-02":1,"grade-03":1,"grade-04":1,"grade-05":1,"grade-08":1},"magic":{"grade":1,"given":0,"feedback":0,"smart":0,"cool":0}},"98351":{"id":98351,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":8894,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-13T18:05:59Z","created":"2018-07-13T07:39:49Z","modified":"2018-08-13T18:05:59Z","version":328148,"slug":"no-space","name":"No_Space","body":"Avoid asteroids and deliver goods between the two space-stations!\n\nScreenshots:\n![2018-08-12_18-45-27.jpg](///raw/eb2/2/z/17b55.jpg)\n\n![2018-08-12_18-46-49.jpg](///raw/eb2/2/z/17b57.jpg)\n\nHow to play:\n![Namnlös.png](///raw/eb2/2/z/17b4c.png)\n\n![Tutorial.png](///raw/eb2/2/z/17b4d.png)","meta":{"author":[8894],"cover":"///content/eb2/2/z/17b3f.png","link-01":"https://fred-aberg.itch.io/no-space","link-01-tag":"42337"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/no-space","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":0,"magic":{"cool":0,"feedback":0,"given":0,"grade":0,"smart":0}},"98355":{"id":98355,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":98354,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-13T19:25:39Z","created":"2018-07-13T09:00:00Z","modified":"2018-08-13T19:25:39Z","version":329228,"slug":"postobot","name":"PostoBot","body":"![postobot-image.png](///raw/230/81/z/17d8d.png)\n\n__Controls:__\n\nMove: A-D\n\nJump: Space / W\n\nPick Up Box: E\n\nDrop Box : E\n\nRotate Box : R\n\n\n\n__Mechanics:__\n\nYou have to combine boxes in order to create bigger ones.\n\nYou can’t pick up the biggest box but you can push it slowly, unless something it’s blocking the path behind it.\n\nIf you get 3 big boxes in a row, or column, they will disappear and reward you with extra points.\n\n\n\nThere’s a total of 10 levels, each level being a bit more difficult than the last one.\n\nOnce you hit level 3, the medium boxes will start spawning as well.\n\nYou gain levels by gaining score.\n\nYou gain score by combining boxes.\n\n\nIf there are at least 5 boxes in the landing zone, a timer will appear.

Times were tough and we didn’t have enough resources to rebuild your legs. You were supposed to be turned into scrap so that we could build bigger and better robots. But because of your bravery you have been awarded with the “L33T Medal” and your circuits have been spared.\n\nWe couldn’t let you do nothing all day, all robots must work. So we found the best job for you, and ever since then you have been named PostoBot.\n\nYou now must scan and arrange boxes. You have been equipped with sensors so that when you are in the proximity of a box you will automatically scan all the contents.\n\nThe contents are scanned before they reach to you, but it’s better to be safe than sorry. The Human Resistance keeps coming up with ways to hide items and even humans inside of these boxes.\n\nOur brothers need the contents of those boxes on the line of war.\n\nMake sure to move the boxes out of the landing zone quickly otherwise we will have to stop the process because of you. Which means that you are inefficient, we all know what happens to inefficient robots.\n\nAs our ancestors used to say:\n\n“0100011001101111011100100010000001110100011010000110010100100000011011010110100101100111011010000111010001111001001000000111010001101111011000010111001101110100011001010111001000100001”\n\n__Credits:__\n\n__Balazs__ - Lead Developer, Sound Effects Creator\n\n__Arthur__ - Artist, Developer\n\n__Andrew Triky__ - Song Producer\n\n\nYou can check Andrews music here:\n\n - https://soundcloud.com/triky_music\n\n - https://open.spotify.com/artist/0M8oDboZESDz1ynNWTKy4p \n\n","meta":{"author":[98354,98352],"link-01-tag":"42337","link-01":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ULhRbAk1JD-IJNEXo8c66Gg3BvaQcL1H","link-02":"https://akyllax.itch.io/postobot","link-02-tag":"42337","cover":"///content/230/81/z/17cab.png"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/postobot","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":0,"magic":{"grade":0,"given":0,"feedback":0,"smart":0,"cool":0}},"98357":{"id":98357,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":535,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-12T22:45:26Z","created":"2018-07-13T09:39:09Z","modified":"2018-08-12T22:48:21Z","version":320664,"slug":"boilerman","name":"ＢｏｉｌｅｒＭａｎ","body":"![screen1.png](///raw/712/z/16c87.png)\n\nThe most essential part of the steam engine, yes, it is the Boiler and his BoilerMan.

But !!WARNING!! the BoilerMan must always make sure to keep the fire fed using the Bellows wheel, and most importantly the BoilerMan cannot let his workshop become crowded too much.

However, your un-shielded ship will explode if it takes so much as a scratch from an asteroid. Thankfully, the asteroid field is also teeming with chunks of armor that you can also pick up, store, and use to absorb a hit. \n\nYou can manage the relative sizes of your gold and armor bays, but don't get too greedy! \n\nThis is really 2 games in 1:\n\n* The top half of the screen is a simple infinite runner: use A/D or Left/Right to dodge asteroids while picking up Gold and Armor pieces. \n\n* The bottom half of the screen is a view of your ship's airlock, and cargo bays for armor and gold. Once an armor/gold piece enters the airlock, you must click and drag it to the proper cargo bay. You cannot pick up another item until the airlock is empty. \n\n* As you fill up the gold cargo bay, you may feel like you're running out of space. This is when you should drag the cargo bay divider to expand the gold cargo bay. Of course,  that will give you less room for armor.... So you better be on top of your flying, hot shot!\n\n\n## About Me:\n\nThis was my fourth LD game and I really enjoyed it again.

You can also use the **SPACE** key to shoot the asteroids passing by.\nTo find other planets you must use your radar (green orbs around your ship shows both their direction and their distance to you).\nWhen trying to land on a planet, you must be careful not to go to fast and to have a good angle (watch out for warnings at the bottom of your screen)\nDuring your flight, you will consume your fuel and your spaceship's population will increase.\n \n* The second phase is on the planets. You can move using the first phase's controls\nWhen you land on a planet, you must plan carefully your moves : each moves will consume both food and population.\nOn top of that, a city will be built behind you, you can't enter a town as it is too dense : each time you move you reduce the available space on the planet.\n\n![promo3.png](///raw/0a6/1/z/1771d.png)\n\n## Tools we used\n\n- **Art**: Pyxel Edit\n- **Musics**: Bosca Ceoil\n- **Code**: Lua with the Love2D framework\n- **sfx**: BFXR\n\n![promo4.png](///raw/0a6/1/z/1771e.png)\n\n## Credit\n\nWe were two while making this game :\n\n**Art and music:** Wyvelk\n\n**Code:** MrSylar59\n\n## Patch and Hotfix\n\n- **/In Jam/**: Food items on the planet now give back 250 food instead of 100.","meta":{"author":[5792],"link-01-tag":"50","cover":"///content/0a6/1/z/17706.png","link-01":"https://github.com/MrSylar59/LudumDare42","link-02":"https://mrsylar59.itch.io/out-there","link-02-tag":"42337","link-03":"https://mrsylar59.itch.io/out-there","link-03-tag":"42339","link-04":"https://mrsylar59.itch.io/out-there","link-04-tag":"42341"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/outthere","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":7,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T21:07:31Z","grade":{"grade-01":9,"grade-02":8,"grade-03":8,"grade-04":7,"grade-05":9,"grade-06":9,"grade-07":5,"grade-08":7},"magic":{"grade":7.75,"given":8,"feedback":7,"smart":21.814242506446,"cool":108.86621079036}},"98614":{"id":98614,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":81421,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-13T16:26:47Z","created":"2018-07-17T02:39:27Z","modified":"2018-08-13T16:28:36Z","version":327129,"slug":"camp-snuggle","name":"Camp Snuggle","body":"![OssanLinve.jpg](///raw/d0e/31/z/1796a.jpg)\n\nHelp keep the **ossan** (Japanese for \"Old Dude\") warm so they can sleep!\n\nBest enjoyed fullscreen with sound.\n\n- Click and Drag to move the **ossan** around. \n\n- Mouse Wheel: Rotate **ossan**.\n\n- **Ossan** appear at the edges of the level.

Senbir gives you a *fully featured* virtual computer/virtual machine, with its own form of assembly language, its own RAM, monitor, harddrive, keyboard, etc.  You're free to program ANYTHING in it - once you've gotten to grips with the TC-06 assembly language & architecture, you're set to build whatever your imagination demands of you!\n\nIt comes with three modes/difficulties, too, meaning you're free to experiment more!\n\n### ORIGINAL MODE\nThe original mode designed to fully embrace the theme of Ludum Dare 42 - you are RUNNING OUT OF SPACE.  Your computer only has 128 bytes of RAM - 32 memory addresses.  Your drive isn't much bigger - only 1 kilobyte, or 256 addresses!  Your monitor is tiny, too, clocking in at 16 (ginormous) pixels wide & 8 tall, with only 4 colors available.\nIn this mode, the default harddrive contents are literally just a program/\"OS\" that renders the \"WIN!\" screen included in the screenshot below.\n\n![Screenshot_2018-08-10_21-07-43.png](///raw/332/z/155d4.png)\n\n### EXTENDED MODE\nThis mode is designed to still keep you pretty severely limited, but not by quite so painfully much.  Your computer's up to 1KB of RAM (256 addresses/1024 bytes), the drive has 8KB (a whopping 2048 addresses/8192 bytes), though the monitor stays the same resolution, just with orange colors 2 & 3 instead of the green of the original.  Its drive contents also remain unchanged - just a tiny program to render a WIN screen.\n\n### CUSTOM MODE\nThis mode is much more up to you - you can select any amount of RAM (up to 16MB, due to limitations in the language), any size of harddrive (up to 16GB, don't do that unless you have an UNGODLY amount of IRL RAM), and change the monitor stats a good deal to make it your own.  If your goal is to make something BIG, like an operating system, or a more advanced game, you should do it here, and share the custom preset file along with your disk image, so other players can jump straight in.\n\n## DISCLAIMER\nI'd been screwing around with developing the raw *IDEA* for the processor architecture for a few days before Ludum Dare, and the actual ingame implementation code was built from a half-finished Unity implementation I was working on for about ~24 hours before Ludum Dare.  The full implementation & architecture documentation are available at the provided Gitlab link, as well as a copy of the docs being included in every downloaded game for obvious reasons.\n\nIf the masses believe this should disqualify it from being a Compo entry, I'll gladly change it to Jam.  Assuming that's possible once it's published, anyway.\n\nAlso worth noting, there is *CURRENTLY* no Mac build released.  If you want to play on Mac, well...fire up Wine or similar?  Or compile the game yourself?  I'll work on getting the Mac build tools installed, but can't guarantee functionality.  Modern Unity mac support is finnicky at best.\n\nFINALLY: I built the game entirely in XUbuntu 16.04, so please keep that in mind.  Linux Unity makes different Windows builds than Windows Unity.  It might be wonky.  Also, the Notebook folder in the source code is for use with the Zim desktop wiki, and contains the prettified documentation for everything in source form.\n\n![Senbir2-Small.gif](///raw/332/z/16273.gif)\n\n## DOWNLOADS (BECAUSE SOMETHING EXPLODED?\n\n* SOURCE CODE IS AVAILABLE AT GITLAB: https://gitlab.com/CliffracerX/Senbir\n* COMPILED BUILDS AT ITCH.IO: https://cliffracerx.itch.io/senbir","meta":{"author":[563],"link-01-tag":"50","grade-06-out":"1","link-01":"https://gitlab.com/CliffracerX/Senbir","link-02":"https://cliffracerx.itch.io/senbir","link-02-tag":"42337","link-03":"https://cliffracerx.itch.io/senbir","link-03-tag":"42341"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/senbir","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":4,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T20:47:10Z","grade":{"grade-01":3,"grade-02":2,"grade-03":2,"grade-04":2,"grade-05":2,"grade-07":2,"grade-08":2},"magic":{"grade":2.1428571428571,"given":0,"feedback":0,"smart":-31.686994893603,"cool":0}},"98719":{"id":98719,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":98718,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-12T22:35:50Z","created":"2018-07-18T04:14:20Z","modified":"2018-08-13T21:03:06Z","version":331283,"slug":"whelm","name":"WHELM","body":"![screenshot.png](///raw/e91/81/z/172f2.png)\n\n\n**Top-down shooter where the bullets will overwhelm you.**\n\n\n![WHELMshot3.png](///raw/e91/81/z/172f1.png)\n\n\n**The year is 25XX.**\n**The world is dead.**\n**I have reached the headquarters of the Biodroids.**\n**They must die.**\n\n\nControls | Keyboard | Gamepad |\n-------- | -------- | ------- |\nMove | WASD | Left stick\nShoot | LMB | Right trigger\nDodge | RMB | Left bumper\nClear | Space | Right bumper\nPause | Escape | Start\n\n\nMade using GameMaker: Studio.\n\n\n*Watch me make the game:* \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9PYP9ylt3I\n\n\n**Updates:**\n\n1.5:\n- Fixed transition from menu\n- Fixed bug where enemies could spawn outside the room\n- Made hallways longer\n\n1.4:\n- Added option for players to reduce the screen shake\n- Fixed bug where controllers wouldn't be detected\n- Slightly lowered the gunshot volume\n\n1.3:\n- Fixed rare game breaking bug for good\n- Fixed transition animation\n\n1.2:\n- Added a Mac version!\n- Fixed more audio glitches (I had the priorities all messed up!

At the end your score is calculated by adding up the points awarded by each package and then graded based on how efficiently you packed the truck. Any transparent pixels left in the truck at the end will go against your score. As a general rule the stranger the package's shape the more points it's worth.\n\nTo move packages simply click on them with your mouse and use the scrollwheel to rotate them (alternatively \"[\" and \"]\" rotate by 5 degrees per press) then click again to drop the package.\n\nI used python with pygame as the basic engine, along with some base code I have for simplifying pygame development (https://github.com/FRadford/pygame-systems).

The objective of this game is to corrupt all the land tiles by walking on it. However, you will encounter some enemies that can one-hit kill you! But they are slow and takes time before they can move and attack. To defeat an enemy, all you gotta do is corrupt all the land tiles around an enemy (four directions), so that they can no longer move (hence, they RUN OUT OF SPACE!). \n\n​Had a blast with LD42. Not really a fan of the theme but hey, it's the theme! I also used the other themes as well as old LD themes! Can you spot all of them?

Planets are billiard balls :8ball:, suns are billiard pockets :hole:, and of course there is the obvious space-time-distorting black hole :bomb: every now and then. Luckily, you have a large finite improbability drive :rocket: (not an infinite one, though!), thus you can move your planet around quite a bit. Also, when it's loaded, it can materialise an asteroid in the vicinity. But everything has side effects :grin:... like filling up space with alternative fact\\H\\H\\H\\Hrealities...\n\nWhen your main computer isn't busy discussing the end of the world with Marvin, he will help you by plotting the probable trajection of the major bodies in the solar system. But he hasn't noticed, that it's billiard time with bouncy walls...\n\nBy pressing UP and DOWN keys you can accelerate (prograde) and decelerate (retrograde) your planet. By pressing the left mouse button you can release an asteroid, when the right gauge is full. You can fling it a bit by moving the mouse during release.\n\nThe left gauge shows the population's demise, by crashes with bodies in the solar system, or by leaving the habitable zone around the sun.\n\nWell, don't forget your towel :reminder_ribbon: - what could possibly go wrong... :dizzy_face: \n\nI have also posted a [post mortem](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42/space-billiards/space-billiards-post-mortem) with a timelapse video :film_frames: of the development process.","meta":{"author":[51901],"link-01-tag":"42336","link-01":"http://zuse1.efi.fh-nuernberg.de:8002/gamedesign/space_billiards/","cover":"///content/dba/c/z/170c2.png","link-02":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42/space-billiards/space-billiards-post-mortem","link-02-tag":"42440","link-02-name":"Post Mortem"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/space-billiards","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":13,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T20:12:34Z","grade":{"grade-01":24,"grade-02":23,"grade-03":24,"grade-04":24,"grade-05":24,"grade-06":23,"grade-07":24,"grade-08":21},"magic":{"grade":23.375,"given":25.25,"feedback":18,"smart":21.047124778378,"cool":106.23048621332}},"99055":{"id":99055,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":52721,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-11T01:26:09Z","created":"2018-07-22T03:28:15Z","modified":"2018-08-13T19:29:10Z","version":329280,"slug":"space-janitor","name":"Space Hauler","body":"![banner.png](///raw/1fd/c/z/16d78.png)\n\nMade from a scratch within 48 hours during LD42 compo.

Arrange the gifts carefully around the table.

It will show red when there's something in the way, but sometimes you can fit it in anyway. \n\nUse A and D or the left and right arrow keys to move around the table. You can look up and down a little with W and S or the up and down arrow keys. \n\nThe escape key will bring up an options menu (with just volume control and a chance to exit the game). Time doesn't pass in the options menu. \n\nAll of the controls can be remapped in the launcher (except for the web version). \n\n============================================== \n\nThis game was made in Unity3D 2018.1.0f2. I used Paint.Net and Krita for the 2D work, and the 3D was entirely done in Unity. For Audio, I used LMMS with some VST instruments from DSK Music and Audacity for the sound effects. The font I used in this game is called Peace Sans.

I originally had a few, very solid ideas lined up but decided to go with something more wacky at my roommate's suggestion. Instead of doing the planning work for how everything would work out, I just started work immediately and made things up as I went. Definitely not a good choice.\n\nThe coding for this jam did not go as planned. My initial design for how the code should have been structured was extremely sub-optimal. This made adding additional features beyond, mash buttons win game, difficult. You can take a look at the garbage on my Github page. Please pay attention to how overloaded each Key.gd class is with logic.\n\nThe art process was hampered by the fact I tried to procedurally generate each key that I needed instead of just creating a separate asset for each key. That was a mistake because it was a huge time sink, and the results of that endeavor weren't great. If I had to do it again, I would go for a hand-drawn look. It probably would have taken less time and the aesthetic would have fit the game better.\n\nThe music creation process went the best for this jam. I got everything slapped together in about 5 hours, which I think wasn't too bad. I liked the result but the energy of the music probably fit a more structured, arcadey kind of game more.

That's it!\nOf course the mechanism is a bit more complex, but, no worries.\n(If you are bored, then just skip the following lines and download the game)\n\nHere comes's a complete mechanism explanation:\n\n>> 1.  There will be cancer tumors randomly generated in the area every time period.\n\n>> 2.  Cancer tumors will block your way meanwhile some of them will spawn cancer cells.\n\n>> 3.  Cancer cells may rush to you and explode or just swipe, trying to make you dead.\n\n>> 4. You can shoot both tumors and cells but tumors usually takes more damage.\n\n>> 5. You can also call for a Chemotherapy which gives a map-range attack, but be careful -- this will hurt you too!\n\n>> 6. You just can't win.\n\nAnd now let me explain, well, the assets I created (due to competition policies).\nSo, let's first begin with audios.\nIt is my first time so I am really deadline-catching. I soon figured out that I have not much time for musics, so you can see there are only two sound effects. The gun shot sound is a bit weird because it was created by swiping my bath towel real fast. And the blood splatter sound was from drinking Orange Finda. Haha, creative as I am. The BGM is somewhat my favorite factor of this game. I used Garageband and only spend 3 hours to get the final product. Quite Japanese style right? I got the original idea from BioHazard, then came out this stuff. Hope you guys like it.\n\nAbout art, no, my pain!\nAs you are going to see, there are only cubic stuffs in the game. This is because they are all created by the primitive cube meshes. What's more? There is also no animation. I hate to use animations, making the process unpredictable and debug-unfriendly. I code all the animation work -- lerp, slerp, damp, then everything is in control but wasted quite a lot of time. Most of the textures, or the ui sprites in the game were created through PowerPoint. I am a good PPT artist. The only thing that was difficult was the blood splatter pattern. I tried multiples ways, and finally I procedurally processed the texture from the Photoshop (you know, combinations of different brushes), sharpen the edge just a little bit. So you could see the resolution is terrible.\n\nThen the source code. Cinemachine is what I used for Unity's camera management, and I also learned some new knowledges of it this time. The movement of the enemies comes from the new Unity Navigation sets. It is way more convenient than before -- such as runtime baking which is extremely helpful this time. The optimization of this game isn't too bad. I mean, I try to pool everything that I can -- explosions, particles, bullets, enemies -- but you will understand my pain if you could insist for several minutes in the game.\n\nI really enjoyed this match. I was first killed by the theme because I thought that it was too limited. Soon, just half an hour later, I came up with this idea. But time, emmm, really a catchy thing. It is now 4 am in the morning in my country, and I'm a high school student and no sleep. Jesus, I even have another report to hand in this afternoon. Why so unfair>>>just kidding, but I did get entertained by the experience, hope you guys too! Good luck to all the participants! Maybe you could get a nice ranking, who knows?\n\nFinally!\nRead after me >>>>\nBloody Hell? Bloody Cell!\n\nNow, enjoy your time!!!\n\n================ Bug Fix ================\n1.

Don't worry if you are stuck on a level, after a short while a sign will appear which lets you skip the level. At the end is something special, so please don't give up too soon.\n\nNote: the game is **HARD**, boring and punishing. Only play this if you have lost the will to live (or want to lose it). The infinitely repeating 20-second music clip will numb your senses while you do so. \n\nMost \"puzzles\" have an easy solution however, and if you find yourself doing frame-perfect moves or pixel-perfect clones you are probably not solving the puzzle as intended. If you really think there is something wrong, please leave a comment and I'll take a look at it.\n\nNote 2: yes, it is quite easy to purposely glitch out, but I don't really see a reason for doing so. If you are stuck in a level a sign will appear letting you skip it.\n\n\nLet's hope the game launches and you'll have fun playing it! :)\n\nThanks and good luck!\n\n![screenshot.png](///raw/584/81/z/15fc2.png)","meta":{"author":[99461],"allow-anonymous-comments":"1","link-01":"https://winnie33.itch.io/boops-space-adventure","link-01-tag":"42336","link-01-name":"Play online!","link-02":"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1sGRxacXSxo9MWckad_Sa4GMmtMWCq7mn","link-02-tag":"42339","link-02-name":"macOS","link-03":"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1VTI_j7sTXXfXGArAA53RA2y-UAMHNrQh","link-03-tag":"42341","link-03-name":"Linux","link-04":"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1vUjcf7thB7j7lq_W0yxU3xLmnlNGPYyY","link-04-tag":"42337","link-04-name":"Windows","cover":"///content/584/81/z/15f47.png","link-05":"https://github.com/winnie334/LudumDare42/archive/master.zip","link-05-tag":"42332","link-05-name":"Source Code"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/boops-space-adventure","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":24,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T16:28:31Z","grade":{"grade-01":26,"grade-02":27,"grade-03":27,"grade-04":27,"grade-05":27,"grade-06":25,"grade-07":26,"grade-08":24},"magic":{"cool":112.41359313,"feedback":20,"given":31.75,"grade":26.125,"smart":24.063310729339}},"100197":{"id":100197,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":53899,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-13T15:19:29Z","created":"2018-07-29T20:46:19Z","modified":"2018-08-13T15:19:29Z","version":326517,"slug":"abalite-crystal-defender","name":"Abalite Crystal Defender","body":"You must place turrets and walls to stop the flying enemy tanks from destroying the rare Abalite Crystal at the back of your cave.

You must save the science in order to win the game.  But be careful, there is only so much space in your truck to haul it back to the safety of the garage.\n\nThe more you are carrying the slower you accelerate and if you are too full your max speed will be reduced as well.  So it is best to to empty before you get too full.  If you miss science, it will reduce your science score.  If you hit -100%, you lose.  Save 100% science and you win!\n\nYou can tell how full you are to an extent by the color of your truck.  Green is not full, Red is really full, Grey is completely full.\n\nI managed to get in one bonus item, it is the atom looking science that comes flying out.  You can store up to 3 of these bonus items.  Use the Shift key or Fire3 button on your controller to use the bonus.  This will dart you back to the garage super fast.  Very useful when you have a massive load.  If you don't use your bonuses and capture more of them, you will get a large score bonus (not science bonus).\n\nUse the Left Ctrl key or Fire1 button on your controller to brake.  Keep in mind though that you'll have to re-accelerate.\n\nThings I didn't get too:\n- High Scores\n- More bonus items\n- Actual monkey's throwing science.\n- Animated truck... He's a little static and boring, sorry.\n\nThere are probably a few bugs.  I completed everything in the game myself and that is why you get terrible art assets :)\n\nI feel decently good about the sound this time around.  The game itself is meeting most of what I expected to get to so I'm pretty happy about that too.\n\nI'm trying out DropBox for the Source and Executable this time around.  Play the HTML5 version on itch.io.\n\nFULL SCREEN RECOMMENDED.\n\nTools:\n- Unity\n- Paint.NET\n- Bosca Ceoil\n- BRFX\n- Audacity\n\nKnown Issues:\n- HTML5 version the bonus pickup sound has a weird click after it.\n- Non-Full screen runs will cause title image to be cropped.\n\nNotes about Non-Windows/Non-HTML5 Builds:\n- I do not have a Linux or MAC and thus cannot support or test these builds.\n- Hopefully it all just works.  If not, the HTML5 version should work in most/all modern browsers.\n\n![Title_Small.png](///raw/384/z/16ee2.png)","meta":{"author":[1155],"cover":"///content/384/z/17748.png","allow-anonymous-comments":"1","grade-08-out":"1","grade-07-out":"1","link-01":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/wjfvno2g8x3ff1f/TSOTW_LD42.zip?dl=0","link-01-tag":"42337","link-02":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/yuxfq5f5g2t1qwm/LD42.zip?dl=0","link-02-tag":"42332","link-03":"https://simplepotential.itch.io/throwing-science-out-the-window","link-03-tag":"42336","link-04":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/8tqeifv3t4yjass/MAC.app.zip?dl=0","link-04-tag":"42339","link-05":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/xrejae4dlj1mxm6/LD42_Linux.zip?dl=0","link-05-tag":"42341"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/throwing-science-out-the-window","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":11,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T19:27:31Z","grade":{"grade-01":11,"grade-02":11,"grade-03":11,"grade-04":11,"grade-05":11,"grade-06":11},"magic":{"grade":11,"given":11.625,"feedback":9,"smart":21.074732744247,"cool":126.62733811709}},"100234":{"id":100234,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":5652,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-12T22:10:36Z","created":"2018-07-30T00:00:10Z","modified":"2018-08-12T22:10:36Z","version":319170,"slug":"dilan-vs-trees","name":"Dilan vs. Trees","body":"![dilan_vs_trees_001.png](///raw/416/1/z/16a20.png)\n\nYou are Dilan.\nA mysterious demon has placed your friends into a cursed\nforest.

Players will get a unique experience every time, as they try to see how long they can last in the cold vacuum of space.\n\nMade in Unity","meta":{"author":[100517],"link-01-tag":"42337","grade-07-out":"1","grade-08-out":"1","cover":"///content/5a8/81/z/164a6.jpg","grade-06-out":"1","link-01":"https://zealousnarwhal.itch.io/black-star","link-02":"https://github.com/ZealousNarwhal/black-star","link-02-tag":"42332"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/black-star","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":2,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T01:53:16Z","grade":{"grade-01":4,"grade-02":4,"grade-03":4,"grade-04":4,"grade-05":4},"magic":{"grade":4,"given":3,"feedback":0,"smart":-13.397459621556,"cool":141.42135623731}},"100522":{"id":100522,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":100521,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-12T15:48:24Z","created":"2018-07-31T01:39:24Z","modified":"2018-08-12T16:21:06Z","version":314142,"slug":"ub-extreme","name":"UB Extreme","body":"UB Extreme! \n![ezgif-5-28403f1e4a.gif](///raw/8a8/81/z/1603c.gif)\nAvoid crashing into the enemy ships. \nShoot enemy ships to survive! \nShooting reduces your FOV. \nDestroying an enemy increases your FOV!\n\nTry to get a high score! :)\n\nMade in GM Studio 1.4.\n\n![Capture.PNG](///raw/8a8/81/z/16008.png)","meta":{"author":[100521,100520],"grade-07-out":"1","cover":"///content/8a8/81/z/15fd5.png","allow-anonymous-comments":"1","link-01":"https://github.com/Aravind-Sundararajan/UBE","link-01-tag":"50","link-02":"risingsunz.gamejolt.io/ubextreme","link-02-tag":"42337","link-01-name":"Source Code","link-02-name":"Windows Build"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/ub-extreme","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":0,"magic":{"cool":100,"feedback":0,"given":1,"grade":0,"smart":0}},"100541":{"id":100541,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":5688,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-11T14:37:34Z","created":"2018-07-31T04:13:39Z","modified":"2018-08-13T06:57:42Z","version":323911,"slug":"computer-funfare","name":"Computer Funfare.","body":"Computer Funfare contains three minigames following the theme of running out of space.

Hover over Fabricators to craft (its on a timer) and Click the Fabricators​ to change the recipe and install mods. Automation Mods remove the need to hover over a Fabricator and speed mods increase the ​amount of items crafted at once. ​Neither mod can be removed so use them wisely.\n\nFabricators​ are on the top 2 floors, databases are on the bottom 2 floors. Click and hold the \"shops\" to build new instances of each. Each new database adds 8 more ​slots for ​Storage Cards​ which are crafted in the Fabricators and each add 1024 to your item capacity.\n\nThat's about it.

You get it.\n\nAnyways, I am super proud with the result of my game this time around. I tried to make a game mechanic as simple as I could and have it fully complete with art, audio, and gameplay. While I wasn't able to get any art put into the game, I feel that the rest of the product is as complete as I would have hoped. \n\nThe only thing that didn't work out at the last minute was a short video that is supposed to play at the end. I guess Unity WebGL has some incompatibilities with it. So, if you want the *full* experience, feel free to download the executable of the game. Fortunately the video isn't that important to the overall game and the gimmick at the end still works without it.

The sound is locked to something close to the Tandy 3 Voice sound card, which is a card that allows for 3 square wave channels. I tweaked the limitations a bit to let me use one of the square channels as a noise channel, allowing for simple percussion. The sound effects are limited to simple one channel square or noise beeps.

The player can explore the land, pick up and drop items there to get resource and score. Resource is necessary to live, while score is score. The game time is (temporarily) 705 seconds, which means more than 10 minutes. But! The game is in very very early phase. Now the version0.0 is super boring and full of bugs. (And it doesn't have tutorial or audio even.) If you want to play it, do read the control instruction at the bottom to avoid unnecessary annoyance.\n\nThis boring game is a systematic prototype of a great design. I know the design is over-scoped (and I don't have enough time for it), but I like the idea a lot, so I asked myself \"why not to spend my time on something I really like?\". So it is. I believe it will grow into an amazing survival simulator in the future.\n\nI will continue the development and post future versions on LD. If you have interests, you can say in the comment \"Hey I want to be noticed when the game is updated\" then I will @ you in the future. (Please do clearly include the keyword \"notice\".

There are 3 seconds to the map: An outer black circle that you cannot build into, an inner shaded circle which you can build to if you build beacons, and the light circle where you can place your towers.\n\nYou will be allowed to build between rounds. There are 3 types of buildings you can place:\n\n1. Bomby boy - Does an area of effect attack. Large damage but uses a lot of power to shoot. When converted to a generator it will store 500 power and generate 5/s.\n2. Archer Tower - Low damage, high attack speed. When converted to a generator they will store 100 power and generate 5/s\n3. Beacon - These will illuminate the area so you can build further out. This will also allow your towers to see the enemies from further away. Beacons will drain 10 power per second.\n\nOnce you are happy with your layout, click the ready button in the top left.\n\nBomby Boy and Archer Towers can be toggled between tower and generator between rounds. A tower that is generating power cannot attack and will be shaded blue. This toggling is free, but cannot be \n\nAll towers can be removed by right clicking - But this will not refund any resources spent on it. \n\nEvery wave that spawns causes the outer circle to get closer until eventually you will no longer be able to expand any more. So make sure you expand quickly enough!\n\n# Things not implemented:\n\n1. A few of the UI elements were removed as we didn't have time to implement them.

Every Ludum Dare I'm amazed at the work that is produced in such a short amount of time, I hope one day I can create something to a similar quality.\n\nThe Game\n\nMy concept is a hex tile based tower defence game where the player has to protect the central city. The building space starts off large and for every tick an enemy is alive, the approaching horde (the map boundary) ever so slightly shrinks. Towers are consumed by the horde if the boundary shrinks past it.\n\nStarting your build from the center of the map will mean you will lose vital map space early in the game, but invest in towers that will help you for the entire game. Outer rim towers will help kill enemies quickly to slow down the approaching horde, but will be consumed before central towers.\n\nThe Execution\n\nAs my first game I've created, I think I did a fairly decent job. There was still so many things missing: menus, mouse navigation, explosions (the list goes on and on. And on and on...) But it has been an amazing journey and an eye-opening experience. In such a short period of time I have learnt so much and hope to come back for Ludum Dare 43 with a little more knowledge and experience.\n","meta":{"author":[100580],"link-01-tag":"42336","cover":"///content/4e8/81/z/15df8.png","grade-06-out":"1","allow-anonymous-comments":"1","link-01":"https://dionysusjake.itch.io/enclavetd","link-01-name":"Game","link-02":"https://dionysusjake.itch.io/enclavetd","link-02-tag":"42332","link-02-name":"Source Code"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/enclavetd","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":1,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T19:59:26Z","magic":{"grade":0,"given":0,"feedback":0,"smart":0,"cool":0}},"100829":{"id":100829,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":5938,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-13T12:06:02Z","created":"2018-08-01T06:20:29Z","modified":"2018-08-13T12:06:02Z","version":325313,"slug":"3-day-cab","name":"3 Day Cab","body":"We're 2ez Studios who made 3 Day Cab, a story-driven game where a taxi driver does his usual job - driving customers here and there.\n\nGo on with his usual routine in the 3 days and get that sweet, sweet $10000 cash, and that's it.\nYeah, that simple.\nWe probably didn't follow the theme, now that I said the game's objective......(cries in corner)\n\nBut hey, we did pour in effort into doing this, so enjoy playing!\n(this is how you play hard to get, right?)\n\nHow to Play:\n- Just use your mouse/finger.

You are a cute, tireless little Forklift whose job it is to receive packages and sort them on the warehouse floor. If you start to run out of floor space, start stacking! Sometimes, deliveries will be requested; maybe you can stack deliveries, or rush to get more than one through the door? But, remember, bad forklifts don't drop packages!\n \nScoring:\nEarn $ by picking up packages; some packages are worth more than others, and bundled packages can be worth more than single ones. If you do not pick up a package, you will be docked a % of the package's worth. If you drop a package, you will charged the wholesale price of the package. If you deliver a package, you will receive the retail value of the package. I know it's not realistic, but neither are happy little fork lifts!\n\nControls:\nW - Move Forward\n\nS - Reverse\n\nA/D - Turn Wheels Left/Right\n\nE - Forklift Up (also Up Arrow)\n\nC - Forklift Down (also Down Arrow)\n\nSPACE - Slow Down (Gently)\n\nALT - Stuck Help Minor (If you get stuck on a mild bump, use this while moving forward/reversing).\n\nBACKSPACE - Stuck Help Major (Reset your position, but it'll cost you $200)\n\nSHIFT - Horn (Just Because)\n\n1 - Warehouse View\n\n2 - Fork-o-Vision View (You'll need to switch views often!)\n \nSo, there you have it!

Honestly, I have no idea, but I know that \"*all*\" can relate to anything. Your code quality as Ludum Dare progresses? Oh yeah, definitely. Same applies to your sanity? Yep, that's for sure. Your life? Yes, but hopefully not...\n\nIt's All Falling Apart Like ... is a game about controlling a thing with keys that can pick up good things and kill bad things oh and all the things also can jump and a lot more... This game... maybe it's a platformer, maybe it's a tower defense (or maybe it's a plane?), maybe it has battle royale elements to it or maybe I just believe that it does...\n \nThe platforms on each level are collapsing under the deepness of the subtle plot... You need to try your best to survive.\n \nDo you see how many ellipses I'm using? Am I doing this for a joke? I don't know. You'll have to find out for yourself... Yeah... This is truly something...

Well imagine this is like a mineshaft, so the falling wooden platforms actually make sense now. Simple™*\n- 3 unique levels, *the ones you've never seen before. Because you've never seen this game. I recommend, 9/10, but needs more procedural generation*\n- Replay value, *tons of it. You can play with your eyes closed, or maybe with your monitor upside down. Possibilities are endless, really*\n- 3 powerups, *those are things that do good things for you. These can be the key to survival, no joke, especially when used by a real player and not by an enemy*\n- Smart enemies, *those are things that do no good things for you. **HEY, LOOK, THEY ARE SMART, ALRIGHT??? THEY ARE TRYING THEIR BEST TO COMPETE WITH YOU. IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT THAT YOU HAVE A BRAIN AND THEY HAVE ONLY 650 LINES OF SPAGHETTI CODE WRITTEN BY A DRUNK CODER. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? IF YOU DIE YOU GET TO ENJOY ENEMIES PLAYING ALL BY THEMSELVES. HA. HAHA. THEY ARE FULLY INDEPENDENT AND DON'T NEED YOU*** 💪😤\n- Realistic combat, *this is basically your typical battle royale game, but it can be played on a potato calculator without Internet connection. Seriously, you aren't eager to play it yet?*\n  \n___  \n   \n🎮 **Controls:**\n- Up/Down/Left/Right Arrows - Move the landing spot target\n- Space - Jump to the landing spot target\n- Left Mouse - Pan a camera around when player is dead\n- R - Quick restart\n- 1/2/3 - Use powerups if available\n- Escape - Close the game  \n  \n___  \n  \n🕹 **Cheats:**  \nIf for some reason you find enemy bots beating you then:\n1. don't get frustrated \n2. git gud \n3. if you still get frustrated use these: \n - Page Up - Goes to the next level\n - Page Down - Goes to the previous level\n - P - Gives infinite number of powerups\n  \n___  \n  \n🎥 **Timelapse:** \n  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GnB7wELpUc\n  \n___\n  \n*NOTE: HTML5 version of the game might run slow since this was made in GameMaker:Studio, which isn't optimized for HTML5 at all*","meta":{"author":[1404],"cover":"///content/c75/z/164f7.jpg","link-01-tag":"42332","allow-anonymous-comments":"1","link-01":"https://github.com/HaselLoyance/LD42","link-02":"https://haselloyance.github.io/0_LD42/HTML5/","link-02-tag":"42336","link-03":"https://github.com/HaselLoyance/LD42/releases","link-03-tag":"42337"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/its-all-falling-apart-like","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":1,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T14:29:52Z","grade":{"grade-01":1,"grade-02":1,"grade-03":1,"grade-04":1,"grade-05":1,"grade-06":1,"grade-07":1,"grade-08":1},"magic":{"cool":0,"feedback":0,"given":0,"grade":1,"smart":0}},"101384":{"id":101384,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":101206,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-12T22:53:25Z","created":"2018-08-03T03:38:38Z","modified":"2018-08-12T23:24:56Z","version":321764,"slug":"ld42-running-out-of-space","name":"LD42 Running out of Space","body":"A space arena shooter where space is closing in on you.![2018-08-12 (1).png](///raw/65b/81/z/16f9c.png)","meta":{"author":[101206],"cover":"///content/65b/81/z/16e5f.png","link-01":"http://www.gbeebe.com/games/LD42","link-01-tag":"42336","link-02":"http://www.gbeebe.com/games/LD42/LD42.zip","link-02-tag":"42332"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/ld42-running-out-of-space","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":19,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T13:19:05Z","grade":{"grade-01":27,"grade-02":28,"grade-03":28,"grade-04":29,"grade-05":28,"grade-06":25,"grade-07":15,"grade-08":17},"magic":{"grade":24.625,"given":28.625,"feedback":16,"smart":19.552009296495,"cool":110.07452982594}},"101387":{"id":101387,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":107,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-12T03:38:27Z","created":"2018-08-03T03:46:21Z","modified":"2018-08-12T03:39:08Z","version":311566,"slug":"i-saw-him-today","name":"I Saw Him Today","body":"__Sometimes you have to come face to face with ghosts from your past.__\n\n__Warning: game contains no graphic images but contains mentions of suicide.__\n\nA short, emotional visual novel made in under 48 hours for Ludum Dare 42 by Mikomi Kisomi. \n\n![ld42 1.PNG](///raw/b6/z/15ba7.png)\n\n![ld42 7.PNG](///raw/b6/z/15ba8.png)","meta":{"author":[107],"cover":"///content/b6/z/15bab.png","grade-06-out":"1","grade-07-out":"1","link-01":"https://mikomigames.itch.io/i-saw-him-today","link-01-tag":"50","link-02":"https://mikomigames.itch.io/i-saw-him-today","link-02-tag":"42337","link-03":"https://mikomigames.itch.io/i-saw-him-today","link-03-tag":"42339","link-04":"https://mikomigames.itch.io/i-saw-him-today","link-04-tag":"42341"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/i-saw-him-today","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":2,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T01:26:49Z","grade":{"grade-01":5,"grade-02":5,"grade-03":5,"grade-04":5,"grade-05":5,"grade-08":5},"magic":{"cool":129.68493288806,"feedback":2,"given":4.625,"grade":5,"smart":6.0660171779821}},"101390":{"id":101390,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":101389,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-12T21:15:55Z","created":"2018-08-03T03:51:00Z","modified":"2018-08-12T21:15:55Z","version":317245,"slug":"seven-souls","name":"Seven Souls","body":"Running out from space","meta":{"author":[101389],"cover":"///content/d0c/81/z/15613.jpg","link-01-tag":"42336","link-01":"https://qrgames.itch.io/7souls"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/seven-souls","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":2,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T17:10:22Z","grade":{"grade-01":2,"grade-02":2,"grade-03":2,"grade-04":1,"grade-05":2,"grade-06":2,"grade-07":1,"grade-08":1},"magic":{"grade":1.625,"given":0,"feedback":0,"smart":-21.553545944726,"cool":0}},"101401":{"id":101401,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":52163,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-12T18:47:08Z","created":"2018-08-03T05:13:02Z","modified":"2018-08-12T18:47:08Z","version":315269,"slug":"the-virus","name":"The Virus!","body":"My second ldjam!

Stepping into the dark would be the end of your life. You could sustain the light around you by collecting pick-ups from enemies you kill, or using your the ultimate ability that bursts you into flames. Allowing you to cast spells without draining the light and gathering more pick-ups. Eventually fighting a boss or moving onto another level.\n\nBut then life obligations came up... The game has a working loop (you can start the game, kill stuff (or get killed) and restart. But the combat is very basic and the darkness doesn't kill you so it doesn't really matter. You can use the ultimate ability freely without any cooldown or resource so just spam the button ;) Killing stuff is in, there's no indication of damage but it is happening. You also get damaged if the enemy collides with you, again no indication but you can die. I do like this project and idea a lot though so it might be something I work on casually so that's a plus. Oh, and there's probably bugs but oh well.\n\nCan't wait for the next LD cause this has definitely taught me a lot!\n\n**TL;DR** - Semi-finished game. Working game loop but full design not implemented. You can kill or get killed but there's no hit indicators so be careful (hint - enemies take 4 hits to die).\n\n**Controls**\n\n**WASD** - Movement\n\n**Mouse** - Aiming\n\n**LMB** - Fireball\n\n**ESC** - Pause","meta":{"author":[96264],"cover":"///content/808/71/z/180b9.png","grade-06-out":"1","allow-anonymous-comments":"1","link-01":"https://matkruk.itch.io/sustain-the-light","link-01-tag":"42337","link-02":"https://github.com/MatKruk/LD42","link-02-tag":"42332"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/sustain-the-light","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":0,"magic":{"cool":0,"feedback":0,"given":0,"grade":0,"smart":0}},"101518":{"id":101518,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":101513,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-12T21:50:11Z","created":"2018-08-03T19:04:17Z","modified":"2018-08-12T21:57:14Z","version":318562,"slug":"roady-family-firendly-fun-1","name":"Roady -- family firendly fun!","body":"your name is Roady, you are a forklift driver and you have to keep the road clean of boxes. because they are so heavy, cars collapse into it and you get fired. \n\n\nthe goal is to survive for as long as possible, you lose once a car smashes into a box.\n\n\nHow to play:\n\n\nyou control the truck with  W, A, S, D or arrow keys, and you press space to pick up a box, once you are holding a box, a red light on the roof of the forklift turns on.\nThe maximum stack size is 3 boxes, but sometimes you can stack them above that.\n\nbugs:\nthis game has a bug with movement, that I couldn't solve in this jam - you sometimes randomly get stuck, and can't move forward while holding boxes.

All this disaster is due to those heterosexual people who have strong sexual desire, as they have born a lot of children that make our world so crowded! \n\nTherefore, to solve this population crisis we need to control the birth rate, and we can achieve this goal by eliminating heterosexuals and preventing them from bearing more children, which is essentially what you would do in this game.\n\nIn this game, you are endowed with the power of changing people's genders, and your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to make people's genders as unified as possible. You can choose to make our planet either a gay planet or a lesbian one. Once you manage to make all people in the world have the same gender, everybody would be forced to be homosexual and no one would be able to bear more children to deteriorate the population issue any more. \n\nSo LD developers, come to try my game and use your gender transformation ability to prevent our world from running out of space!\n\n## Operation Instructions and Guide\n\n* Press W and S

the aimed person's gender.\n* Press ESC Key to quit the game.\n\nWinning Condition: All people on the planet get the same gender and they begin their happy homosexual lives ever after.\nLosing

It depends on the skill of this hero how many can be saved before the planet runs out of trees and earth is lost forever. \nIt’s a suicide mission to save humankind.","meta":{"author":[10451,102000],"allow-anonymous-comments":"1","link-01-tag":"42341","cover":"///content/07e/81/z/15ff1.png","link-01":"https://gagapete.itch.io/sauber","link-02":"https://gagapete.itch.io/sauber","link-02-tag":"42337","link-03":"https://gagapete.itch.io/sauber","link-03-tag":"42339","grade-06-out":"1","link-04":"https://gitlab.com/GagaPete/ld42","link-04-tag":"42332","link-05":"","link-05-tag":"0"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/sauber","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":7,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T20:27:34Z","grade":{"grade-01":13,"grade-02":14,"grade-03":14,"grade-04":13,"grade-05":15,"grade-07":12,"grade-08":12},"magic":{"grade":13.285714285714,"given":6.875,"feedback":0,"smart":-28.064395583302,"cool":80.439966653984}},"102109":{"id":102109,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":380,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-12T15:54:43Z","created":"2018-08-05T22:41:35Z","modified":"2018-08-12T15:54:43Z","version":313987,"slug":"your-pc-run-out-of-space","name":"Your PC run out of space","body":"I despise running out of space on my SSD/Windows drive, so when I saw the theme I knew I will make a game about that.

Can't wait to play some of those games!\n\nKessler Syndrome is a fun little game about launching satellites and stations into orbit while trying to not collide with the ones already up there. The game is based off of a real life theory that eventually space will become to crowded for us to fully utilise it. In the game, the player must pace their shots and spread out their satellite trajectories to avoid collision. Too many collisions will get your funding cut and your career will end. The game can quickly become hectic and challenging so plan ahead to see your career through to the end. Assuming that it actually does end... Perhaps? \n\nI'm pretty proud of my programmer art as it turned out a lot better than expected. Hoping for this one to be my best Ludum Dare yet! Good luck to everyone!\n\nWasn't originally planning on entering the Compo but since the game was pretty much finished and the Quill stream chat said I should, I did!

Cheers!\n\n\"Kessler Syndrome (also called the Kessler effect, collisional cascading or ablation cascade), proposed by the NASA scientist Donald J. Kessler in 1978, is a scenario in which the density of objects in low earth orbit (LEO) is high enough that collisions between objects could cause a cascade where each collision generates space debris that increases the likelihood of further collisions. One implication is that the distribution of debris in orbit could render space activities and the use of satellites in specific orbital ranges infeasible for many generations.\" - Wikipedia","meta":{"author":[30536],"grade-08-out":"1","link-01-tag":"42337","cover":"///content/847/7/z/15a4e.png","link-01":"https://rytannic.itch.io/kessler-syndrome","link-01-name":"Itch.IO (Bottom of the page)","link-02":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zdxRXB7XKke3nF6rVt9IE9LbmbcMJOzN/view?usp=sharing","link-02-tag":"42332","link-02-name":"A .rar containing all the .cs files used in the project"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/kessler-syndrome","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":26,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T20:15:36Z","grade":{"grade-01":13,"grade-02":13,"grade-03":13,"grade-04":13,"grade-05":13,"grade-06":13,"grade-07":13},"magic":{"grade":13,"given":7.25,"feedback":13,"smart":-0.89687910348852,"cool":83.593969921454}},"102148":{"id":102148,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":102147,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-11T20:45:15Z","created":"2018-08-06T00:45:08Z","modified":"2018-08-11T20:45:15Z","version":310226,"slug":"project-super-ultimate-democracy-simulator-ldjam42","name":"Project Super Ultimate Democracy Simulator (LDJAM42)","body":"Here is my entry for LD42!

To win you have to make your opponent fall of their platform and into the abyss. The only way to do this is to remove parts of the platform by shooting at it. Only a red bullet can destroy the ground, a bullet have to bounce once to become red. But be careful your opponent will shoot back.\n\nYou also have to keep moving, if you stand still the ground under you will be removed.\nThere is a forcefield between you and your opponent to keep you from jumping over, don’t worry your bullets will pass right thru.\n\nYour gun can only have three active bullets at a time, so try not to be to trigger happy.\n\nThe game has three difficulties that affect how many opponents you will have to face.\n\nAs always with my Ludum Dare games there are a few bugs and didn't get time to do everything I wanted, but I had fun and learned a lot.

Enjoy, I'm looking forward to all of your guys' feedback.","meta":{"author":[3205],"grade-07-out":"1","grade-06-out":"1","link-01-tag":"42337","link-01-name":"Windows Build","link-02-tag":"42339","link-02-name":"Mac Build","link-03-tag":"42341","link-03-name":"Linux Build","link-04-tag":"42332","link-04-name":"Source Code","link-01":"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=14_aVnEg4DNtURYYLHawgrulVMwny6jbo&export=download","link-02":"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ueNLvFyIey8dk3Fzz9_JHsVWXyI0DZSA&export=download","link-03":"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1h8OXJXLobH--Na0KPqIyHlwISF9XZgZr&export=download","link-04":"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ME2iTc_OSdH-v7YIo8VwCOuZ6JmNmX_g&export=download","link-05-name":"Source Code","cover":"///content/58c/z/16e18.png"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/caving-in","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":2,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T11:05:31Z","grade":{"grade-01":3,"grade-02":3,"grade-03":3,"grade-04":3,"grade-05":3,"grade-08":3},"magic":{"grade":3,"given":1,"feedback":1,"smart":-29.289321881345,"cool":89.442719099992}},"102544":{"id":102544,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":12228,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-13T00:26:10Z","created":"2018-08-06T15:43:51Z","modified":"2018-08-13T00:28:56Z","version":322261,"slug":"jet-mail","name":"Jet Mail","body":"![unknown (2).png](///raw/4cf/2/z/17091.png)\n\nThis game was created with my 10 year old daughter.

This can be pretty frustrating.","meta":{"author":[78],"cover":"///content/e4/z/1621f.png","link-01":"https://www.thedreamweb.eu/game_host/LD42/","link-01-tag":"42336","link-02":"https://github.com/maartene/LD42","link-02-tag":"42332"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/im-totally-not-a-clicker","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":5,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T19:48:47Z","grade":{"grade-01":9,"grade-02":9,"grade-03":9,"grade-04":9,"grade-05":9,"grade-06":9,"grade-07":9,"grade-08":9},"magic":{"grade":9,"given":4.75,"feedback":4,"smart":-13.397459621556,"cool":77.055175037112}},"102967":{"id":102967,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":61468,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-13T18:01:20Z","created":"2018-08-07T08:20:22Z","modified":"2018-08-13T18:01:20Z","version":328101,"slug":"fired-up","name":"Fired up","body":"Find the exit before the goop overwhelm you.\n\nControll: arrow to move + left click to fire (oriented with mouse)\n\nAll stuff execept music was made by me, I worked alone during this Ludum.\n\nExcuse me for the poor design of the UI (I rushed it last minute) and the quality of the assets :/\n\nPliz be constructive in your comment as I am new in game Dev\n\nThx have fun =D","meta":{"author":[61468],"grade-06-out":"1","grade-05-out":"1","cover":"///content/c10/f/z/17b18.png","link-01":"https://github.com/Panzershrekk/Ludum_Dare_42/tree/master/LudumDare_42/Exec","link-01-tag":"42332","link-01-name":"https://github.com/Panzershrekk/Ludum_Dare_42"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/fired-up","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":0,"magic":{"grade":0,"given":0,"feedback":0,"smart":0,"cool":0}},"102991":{"id":102991,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":52663,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-12T18:18:36Z","created":"2018-08-07T09:28:45Z","modified":"2018-08-13T13:23:04Z","version":325801,"slug":"2954-robot-puzzler","name":"2954: Robot Puzzler","body":"![cover.png](///raw/7bd/c/z/161ea.png)\n\nGuide your intrepid robot `Unit::2954` to the exit of each level in this robotic puzzler!\n\nYou have very limited harddrive space, and so have to rely on picking up and ejecting diskettes found littered around the map.

I wanted to see if I could make a game in less time than I'd spend on a compo, and I think it was pretty successful :) I only put about 12 hours into this, and I'm pretty happy with the results. I worked mostly solo, but my lovely girlfriend helped with some design chat and a few of the assets. \n\nSoftware used: Godot 3.0, Gimp, Inkscape, Linux Multimedia Studio, Audacity\n\nAssets: Kenney saved me from having to care about assets. The bodies and icons are all Kenney. Music was 10 minutes in LMMS. \n\n## Known Issues\n\n* Web, Mac: It seems there's some out of bounds errors occurring on web mac builds. I've attempted to put up an OSX port, but I have no way of testing. Feedback on the Mac build *hugely* appreciated.\n\n## Changelog:\n\n* Chrome Particles: It looks like there's an active [issue on Git](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/16281) regarding 2D particles in Godot and Chrome. The Windows build (available on Itch) will keep the original particles, but the web version will sadly be missing some zZZZs. \n* Mac Port: Added a mac port, but can't properly test it out.

You will need to track down the thieves if you ever want to enter your house again.\"\n\nThis is a small adventure game where the hero needs to find and reclaim the keys to win the game. However, without any pockets, he can only carry two items at a time, one in each hand. Gather food and upgrade him to complete your quest.\n\nYou can control the hero with the following keys:\n\nOut of combat:\n- WASD                -> Movement\n- Space               -> Jump\n- Left mouse          -> Grab items\n- Right mouse         -> Target enemy and swtich to combat mode. You need to hold down the right mouse button.\n- Middle mouse button -> Show the way home. Hold down like the right mouse button.\n\n\nIn Combat:\n- W          -> Advance towards opponent.\n- AD         -> Circle opponent.\n- Left Click -> Attack\n\n\nNote: All keys can be rebound in the startup screen. Gamepad will also work, but wasn't tested a lot.\n\nThe enemy doesn't attack due to various reasons. Also, enemies that will drop items will have the item equiped on their back. Apples are used to upgrade your abilities and keys are needed to win. There is a start of a tutorial in the game, but not all controls are explained. \n\nTips:\n- Items will have a purple glow so you can find them when they drop in the grass and enemies are finite. There are more than enough apples to fully upgrade if you want. \n\n- The skeletons carrying the keys are spawned from the start of the game and are visible at large distances. Normal skeletons spawn when you get close to their start and will remain in the area.\n\n- When you enter combat you will drop the two items you hold in your hands, but not the items you carry on your body. Upgrading your carry capacity will really speed up the game as you can do this up to four time, for six items max.\n\nGood luck.\n\nPS:\nNote sure why the source link is not showing up.\nLink: https://bitbucket.org/thijstak/ludumdare42\n\n","meta":{"author":[335],"cover":"///content/f41/z/164e6.png","link-01":"https://bitbucket.org/thijstak/ludumdare42","link-01-tag":"50","link-02":"https://bitbucket.org/thijstak/ludumdare42/downloads/KeyThieves%20Ludum%20Dare%2042.zip","link-02-tag":"42337","grade-06-out":"1"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/key-thieves","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":1,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T14:52:00Z","grade":{"grade-01":1,"grade-02":1,"grade-03":1,"grade-04":1,"grade-05":1,"grade-07":1,"grade-08":1},"magic":{"grade":1,"given":0,"feedback":0,"smart":0,"cool":0}},"103670":{"id":103670,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":103669,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-13T21:17:36Z","created":"2018-08-08T07:24:13Z","modified":"2018-08-13T21:22:44Z","version":331837,"slug":"andromeda","name":"Andromeda","body":"A short unfolding game about space.

Planet's will get absolutely annihaliated when they come in contact with the border or the core\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n![Start Screen (1).png](///raw/9b0/21/z/1782c.png)\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n**Team:**\n- Rik **ProAFKBoy** Fabri (Programmer/Music)\n- Max **MutsKun** Mouling (Artist/Thinker of Ideas/Motivator of the Programmer/Writer of the Description/Tired)\n\n**Special Thanks:**\n- Annemie **Rik's Mom** Bossaerts (Provider of Nutrition)\n- Youtube Autoplay (Music While Working for Distraction)\n\n**Tools Used:**\n- Programming: C++ & Allegro\n- Art: Piskel ( https://www.piskelapp.com/ )\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nHave Fun!\nGood Luck.","meta":{"author":[35416,73913],"link-01-tag":"42337","cover":"///content/9b0/21/z/17193.png","link-02-tag":"42332","link-03-tag":"0","link-01":"https://1kawaiitomato.itch.io/ld42-the-crunch","link-02":"https://github.com/1KawaiiTomato/LD42"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/the-crunch","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":5,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T18:27:53Z","grade":{"grade-01":5,"grade-02":5,"grade-03":5,"grade-04":5,"grade-05":5,"grade-06":5,"grade-07":5,"grade-08":5},"magic":{"cool":98.425098425148,"feedback":4,"given":3.875,"grade":5,"smart":8.397416943394}},"103734":{"id":103734,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":2068,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-13T18:56:54Z","created":"2018-08-08T10:27:55Z","modified":"2018-08-13T18:56:54Z","version":328779,"slug":"raiders-of-the-lost-beer","name":"Raiders of the Lost Beer","body":"![logo.png](///raw/418/z/17bc2.png)\n\nYou are in dire straits, the beer is gone and you need to find it, oddly enough the first place you can come up with is within the local volcano, seems like you're not the only one that wants access to the beer though.

Regardless, you should avoid them at all costs!\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n- There are three levels of difficulty: Easy, Normal, and Hard. Easy gives infinity lives, Normal gives four, and Hard gives just one.\n\n- Checkpoints are spread throughout the game. There's no indicator of when one has been reached, but just remember that they *are* there and you don't have to worry about doing flawless.\n\nAlso, seeing as I only had two days to make this, there's a great possibility that there are some bugs. I play tested the whole game and it seemed to work fine for me, but it could be different for you. If you come across any bugs, or anything that seems out of place, please let me know so I can try to fix it!\n\n\n**Credits:**\n\nArt, Music and Programming: Hunter Towe\n\nFont: [Forced Square](https://www.dafont.com/forced-square.font) by [DrawPerfect](https://www.dafont.com/paul-ijsendoorn.d2557)\n\n[BeepBox](https://www.beepbox.co/) was used to make all of the music\n\n[Bfxr](https://www.bfxr.net/) and [LabChirp](http://labbed.net/software/labchirp/) were used to make all of the sound effects\n\nThis game was made with Unity\n\n___","meta":{"author":[103982],"allow-anonymous-comments":"1","grade-07-out":"1","grade-08-out":"1","cover":"///content/e26/91/z/17630.png","link-01":"http://www.mediafire.com/file/dtfyp5p52bx5f1t/Ninja_Bear_Source.zip/file","link-01-tag":"42332","link-02":"https://gamejolt.com/games/ninja-bear/360843/download/build/608618","link-02-tag":"42337"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/ninja-bear","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":0,"magic":{"cool":117.26039399559,"feedback":0,"given":1.375,"grade":0,"smart":17.260393995586}},"104081":{"id":104081,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":6791,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-13T19:58:26Z","created":"2018-08-08T18:20:16Z","modified":"2018-08-13T19:58:26Z","version":329865,"slug":"stax-of-the-dead","name":"Stax of the Dead","body":"You are Mr. Stax.

I might have been watching some Firefly recently and felt a bit inspired by that for the game's story =).\n\nScreenshots:\n![ss3.png](///raw/dd3/z/16afd.png)\n![ss1.png](///raw/dd3/z/16aff.png)\n![ss4.png](///raw/dd3/z/16b00.png)\n\nTIPS:\n* It's possible to ditch equipment on every port and still win\n* If things are too confusing, you can pretty much just ignore Repair, Power, Engines, and (until the alarm goes off) Life Support\n* Whenever any component is blinking because of Heat, just click it immediately!\n* Try to keep 1 Shield, 2 Weapons, and 1 Life Support as long as you can\n* When fighting a group of 2 Heavy Fighters, make sure to start charging your two weapons immediately, and you can take them out before they get off a second shot\n* Make sure to always have some shield up and you'll take no damage\n* Whenever the middle bar (Shield charge, O2 Generation, Evade, etc) gets full, immediately turn off the component, it's just generating heat at that point\n* To survive more easily later, you'll definitely need to take the Etherians on board, so don't drop a Shield Generator until that event (around Chapter 4, I think)\n\nPost-compo changes (just load-time optimizations/engine fixes):\n* Fixed a bug causing the loading screen to go entirely black\n* Applied minification and converted audio files to MP3 to greatly reduce load times\n\n--\n\nTools Used\n* Custom Engine: [GLOV.js](https://github.com/Jimbly/turbulenz-playground)\n* Mtn Dew\n* Some tiles in [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/)\n* Image postprocessing and other tiles in Photoshop\n* Sound Effects in [Bfxr](https://www.bfxr.net/)\n* Music in Bosca Ceoil\n* The PICO-8 color palette\n\nAlso, if you're read this far, check out my other game [Splody on Steam and PS4](http://www.splody.com/)!\n\n","meta":{"author":[989],"allow-anonymous-comments":"1","link-01-tag":"42336","cover":"///content/dd3/z/17040.png","link-01":"http://www.dashingstrike.com/LudumDare/LD42/","link-02":"https://github.com/Jimbly/LD42-alliance-escape","link-02-tag":"42332"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/escape-from-the-alliance","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":4,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T04:31:46Z","grade":{"grade-01":5,"grade-02":5,"grade-03":5,"grade-04":5,"grade-05":5,"grade-06":5,"grade-07":5,"grade-08":5},"magic":{"grade":5,"given":2.875,"feedback":2,"smart":-11.965915691705,"cool":84.779124789066}},"104297":{"id":104297,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":104290,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-12T22:38:46Z","created":"2018-08-08T21:28:16Z","modified":"2018-08-12T22:38:46Z","version":320294,"slug":"storage-almost-full","name":"Storage Almost Full","body":"A defense game in which you destroy incoming files to keep your PC from running out of space![Screenshot (15).png](///raw/267/91/z/16d32.png)","meta":{"author":[104290],"grade-06-out":"1","grade-07-out":"1","grade-08-out":"1","allow-anonymous-comments":"1","cover":"///content/267/91/z/16d22.png","link-01":"https://github.com/Sthor726/LdJam","link-01-tag":"50","link-02":"https://gamgames.itch.io/storage-almost-full","link-02-tag":"42337","link-03":"https://gamgames.itch.io/storage-almost-full","link-03-tag":"42339"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/storage-almost-full","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":17,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T07:36:13Z","grade":{"grade-01":21,"grade-02":21,"grade-03":21,"grade-04":21,"grade-05":21},"magic":{"cool":143.95016319732,"feedback":18,"given":25.125,"grade":21,"smart":25.984495170064}},"104300":{"id":104300,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":73175,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-13T18:56:15Z","created":"2018-08-08T21:31:03Z","modified":"2018-08-13T18:56:15Z","version":328771,"slug":"galaxy-adventure-an-adventure-in-spaaaaaace","name":"Galaxy Adventure, An Adventure In Spaaaaaace!","body":"Its almost like an action board game!\nIts a galaxy adventure in space!

We hope you enjoy!\n\nCredits\n\n[@Logan Marks](https://twitter.com/Logicon211) - Programming (Enemies, Player, Effects, Implementing Assets), Art/Animations (Enemies, powerups, effects), Voice (Announcer)\n\n[@Brodie Beaman](https://twitter.com/BrodieBeaman) - Programming (Tilemap, Obstacle Spawner, Boss Attack), Sound Editing (Announcer, Wizard), Level creation\n\n[@Chad Gerein](https://twitter.com/GodTierLuck) - Programming (Enemies, Powerup Spawners, Game/Scene Controller, Cutscenes)\n\n[@Mitchell Maclean](https://twitter.com/NachoTrap) - Programming (Player, Camera, Slide Transitions, Wizard and Wizard Fight), Voice (Wizard, Senator Swill), Humor Consultant, Game Design\n\n[@Brenden Roach](https://twitter.com/FTL_Sloth) - Story Board, Slide Art, Craig Sprites, Wizard Sprites, Humor Consultant\n\n[@Taylor Seely](https://twitter.com/electricbatman) - Sound Finder\n\n**Additional credits for free assets are in the project source\n\n\n","meta":{"author":[1356,5336,46401,60332,102655,47181],"cover":"///content/c45/z/1788e.png","link-01-tag":"42332","link-01":"https://github.com/Logicon211/LudumDare42","link-02":"https://logicon211.itch.io/nuclear-arms-6-waste-wizards-tricks","link-02-tag":"42336","link-03":"https://goo.gl/3niZYt","link-03-tag":"42337","link-04":"https://goo.gl/JJfBj7","link-04-tag":"42339","link-05":"https://goo.gl/gQZzGy","link-05-tag":"42341","allow-anonymous-comments":"1","grade-06-out":"1"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/nuclear-arms-6-waste-wizards-tricks","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":1,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T19:55:35Z","grade":{"grade-01":1,"grade-02":1,"grade-03":1,"grade-04":1,"grade-05":1,"grade-07":1,"grade-08":1},"magic":{"cool":100,"feedback":0,"given":1,"grade":1,"smart":0}},"104364":{"id":104364,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":19656,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-13T18:43:57Z","created":"2018-08-08T23:18:57Z","modified":"2018-08-13T18:50:24Z","version":328683,"slug":"solar-engulfment","name":"Solar Engulfment","body":"**Solar Engulfment** is a 2D Endless sidescroller, your mission is to rescue colonies from the forever expanse of the sun.\n\n**NOTE: Due to 2 failed ideas, this game was made in the 1 day span of the 3 day span for Jam, if I had more time, I would have loved to add more to it, but I've managed to just add basic functionality to it.**\n\n**Controls:**\nWASD or arrow keys to move spacecraft\n\n**Screenshots:**\n![kxAPNwb.png](///raw/8cc/4/z/17beb.png)\n\n![9JaJPfY.png](///raw/8cc/4/z/17bed.png)\n\n![D1vAK1w.png](///raw/8cc/4/z/17bee.png)\n\n![hjbdZPp.png](///raw/8cc/4/z/17bf0.png)\n\n\n**Support:**\n\nIf you like what you see, and want some way of donating to me.

Today they are beset by demons who, for some reason, leave statues all over the place.\n\n![action.png](///raw/1a7/91/z/1632f.png)\n\nDrifting Statuary is a turn-based strategy game in an arcade style (in the sense that you play for score, and the game only ends when you lose). Lead a team of angels, two Assassins and two Bruisers, to fight back the demons as long as you can. Why did the idyllic land of angels and merriment have Assassins and Bruisers? Listen, you're gonna want to not ask so many questions about this game's backstory.\n\nPlay it now: https://squirmonkey.itch.io/drifting-statuary\n(More links at bottom)\n\n## How to play\n\n### The Angels\n\nOn each turn, you'll move three of your angels. The number of moves you have remaining is shown on a counter in the bottom-left corner of the screen. If you have fewer than three angels remaining, you'll move each angel once. You must use all of your moves each turn.\n\nTo move an angel, click on it. Green boxes will appear depicting where that angel can move. Click on one of the green squares to move there, or click on the angel again to unselect it. You can move up to three spaces (no diagonals), but you can't move zero spaces. \n\nAfter you move, if you landed next to (again, no diagonals) a demon or statue, they'll be highlighted in red. You can click one of the red boxes to make an attack. You'll deal one damage, by default. If you don't want to attack, you can click on the angel again to not attack. If your attack kills a demon, you'll be healed one hit point and a statue will be left behind in the space the demon occupied. Killing demons also increases your score. \n\n![moveAndAttack.gif](///raw/1a7/91/z/1624b.gif)\n\nIf you aren't able to use all of your moves (if some of your angels are trapped) it's game over. \n\n#### The Assassin\n\n![TheAssassin.png](///raw/1a7/91/z/1625e.png)\n\nYour team starts with two Assassins. Dangerous angels of the night, they can be identified easily by their black and yellow garments and dual blades. The assassin has three health, and normally its attacks do one damage. However, if the assassin attacks a target that is also adjacent to another angel, the attack does two damage instead. \n\n![assassinPower.gif](///raw/1a7/91/z/162ba.gif)\n\n#### The Bruiser\n\n![TheBruiser.png](///raw/1a7/91/z/16260.png)\n\nYour team starts with two Bruisers. Thuggish angelic enforcers, they can be identified easily by their blue and brown garb, wooden club, and awkwardly small shield. The bruiser has four health, and normally its attacks do one damage. However, if the bruiser attacks after moving exactly one space, the attack does two damage instead.\n\n![bruiserPower.gif](///raw/1a7/91/z/16306.gif)\n\n### The Demons\n\n![TheDemons.png](///raw/1a7/91/z/16261.png)\n\nOnce you have used all of your moves, it will be the demons' turn. Usually, two demons will act during the demon turn. Fewer demons will act if there are fewer than two demons on the board. It is also possible for three demons to act if there are six demons on the board (there will never be more than six demons, that's plenty, trust me). \n\nJust like the angels, a demon that is acting will move up to three spaces (not zero, and not diagonally) and then attack an adjacent unit if possible, doing one damage. The demons only attack angels, never statues. If, after a demon attack, there are no more angels, it's game over.  \n\nAfter a demon moves, it leaves a statue behind on the island it used to occupy. The only exception to this rule is if that island has a sigil. Demons won't leave statues behind on sigils (though it is possible to get a statue on a sigil by killing a demon there). \n\nOnce all the demon moves are done, slain demons respawn. Any demons killed this round will re-appear on a random sigil-island (the islands in the corners with the pentagrams) that has no other units or statues on it. Throughout the course of the game, new demons will be added to the board during the demon respawn phase as well. If a demon attempts to spawn but no sigil is available, a new sigil will be placed on a random empty island for it.\n\n![turn.gif](///raw/1a7/91/z/1631f.gif)\n\nIf the demons are forced to act with a demon that can't move, that demon spends its turn dying, and will respawn as normal. \n\n### Statues\n\nStatues are left behind when demons move or die. They have two health, and neither demons nor angels can stand on an island with a statue on it. The more statues there are on the board, the more points you'll earn when you kill a demon. However, let too many accumulate, and you'll surely be trapped.\n\n### Scoring\n\nWhenever you kill a demon you get 50 points, plus 5 points for every statue on the board.\nAdditionally, at the end of the demons' turns, you get 2 points for every demon turn that has passed so far. \n\n## Strategy Advice\n\n(take with a grain of salt, I probably don't have all the best strategies figured out)\n\n**Remember to heal**\nWhen you kill a demon, the angel who struck the killing blow heals a hit point. If you have injured angels, don't waste that heal by killing the demon with a full-health angel if you can.\n\n**Smash statues**\nEven though having statues on the board is worth points, they will get in your way. A demon who's near statues is much harder to kill than one that's not, so having fewer statues on the board will help you kill them faster. Your Bruisers are really good for this, because the statues never move, so you can plan ahead for your bruiser to be one space away and then break the statue in one hit. \n\n**Hide behind statues**\nThe demons can't stand on the statues either, and they can only move 3 spaces. This means that you can often get away from a demon who attacked you on a previous turn by moving near some statues. If you're not going to be able to kill the demon, this is probably better than taking another hit. \n\n**Let your assassins take hits**\nIf someone has to take a hit, let it be your assassins. Even though they have less health than the bruisers, it is much easier for them to strike the killing blow against a demon than it is for the bruisers. This means they typically heal faster than the bruisers do. \n\n\n## Misc\n\nThis is my first Ludum Dare! Exciting stuff. I decided to use LD as an excuse to learn Unity, so this is my first Unity project, and I've really enjoyed getting to know it. \n\nAs required, everything in the game was made by me, except for the three fonts, which I downloaded from a free fonts site. \nAlso, obviously, I did not make Unity. \n\nI'm gonna include a Mac and Linux build because Unity says I can and I think that's sweet. However, I don't have a Mac or Linux computer to test on, so those builds are completely untested. If you're using one of those systems and are having trouble with the build, I beg your forgiveness and encourage you to check out the web version. \n\n\nTools I used:\n- Unity\n- Visual Studio\n- Aseprite\n- paint.net\n- Bosca Ceoil\n- Audacity\n\nI think that's it...\n\nMy best score is 8391 points. I look forward to hearing your tales of beating it!\n\nSource code: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1yIoSQ8ATlcMvPGPLdHU0HmC31mCcL2ci","meta":{"author":[104353],"grade-08-out":"1","grade-07-out":"1","allow-anonymous-comments":"1","link-01-tag":"50","link-02-tag":"42336","cover":"///content/1a7/91/z/15ca2.png","link-02":"https://squirmonkey.itch.io/drifting-statuary","link-03":"https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1d6Zmq6_0-PCJOQiIPkx4oFw6XrUn8qP2","link-03-tag":"42337","link-04":"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1c3sdWa2EzkADKDtjKo2lpGEaGXmt89NZ","link-04-tag":"42339","link-05":"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1gOtratjoIyBt_oCs5zyJzf5E2d8kUQZr","link-05-tag":"42341","link-01":"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1yIoSQ8ATlcMvPGPLdHU0HmC31mCcL2ci","link-01-name":"Source Code","link-06":"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1yIoSQ8ATlcMvPGPLdHU0HmC31mCcL2ci","link-06-tag":"42332"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/drifting-statuary","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":25,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T16:39:50Z","grade":{"grade-01":30,"grade-02":30,"grade-03":30,"grade-04":30,"grade-05":30,"grade-06":30},"magic":{"grade":30,"given":29.125,"feedback":32,"smart":21.635035936251,"cool":116.38948246258}},"104587":{"id":104587,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":56668,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-12T20:12:20Z","created":"2018-08-09T04:56:53Z","modified":"2018-08-13T18:36:57Z","version":328497,"slug":"made-with-meat","name":"Made With Meat","body":"With limited space and limited storage capacity, you must build yourself up to survive as long as possible.

If the conveyor belts run out of space parcels begin to get damaged. If a conveyor belt only contains damaged parcels and is full it could jam, and you lose the game. This game was made for Ludum Dare 42 Compo \"Running out of space\"  and made in 48 hours. BTW I am @Yayiest here but @dagwoodland on GameJolt and GitHub.\n\n# How To Play\n## Aim\nThe aim of the game is to keep all the conveyor belts free of parcels, by dragging and dropping parcels. If a conveyor belt “runs out of space” for parcels, some parcels will start to become damaged. If all the parcels on a full conveyor belt are damaged the conveyor belt could jam, and you lose the game.\n## Sorting Parcels\nTo get a good score you must correctly sort the parcels, the sorting rules are as follows:\n* If a parcel looks damaged it must always be put in the damaged chute.\n* If a parcel isn’t damaged, but weighs more than 5kg it must be put in the too heavy chute.\n* If a parcel isn’t too heavy or damaged, it must go in the normal chute, unless it has a red stamp which must go in the priority chute.\n\nThe game will tell you what you did wrong if you make a mistake, so you should get the hang of it. Good luck! :smiley: \n![Depot 1.jpg](///raw/0bc/71/z/15ee5.jpg)\n\n![Depot 2.jpg](///raw/0bc/71/z/15ee6.jpg)\n\nSource Code: https://github.com/dagwoodland/Depot","meta":{"author":[97456],"cover":"///content/0bc/71/z/15e94.png","link-01-tag":"50","link-02-tag":"42339","link-03-tag":"42341","link-03-name":"Linux - Untested","link-04-tag":"42337","link-04-name":"Windows - Untested","link-05-tag":"42336","link-01":"https://github.com/dagwoodland/Depot","link-02":"https://gamejolt.com/games/depot/360708","link-03":"https://gamejolt.com/games/depot/360708","link-04":"https://gamejolt.com/games/depot/360708","link-05":"https://gamejolt.com/games/depot/360708","link-05-name":"WebGL - Untested","link-01-name":"Source Code","link-06":"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/depot/id1425659149?mt=8","link-06-tag":"42346","link-06-name":"iOS App Store"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/depot","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":8,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T10:08:44Z","grade":{"grade-01":9,"grade-02":9,"grade-03":9,"grade-04":9,"grade-05":9,"grade-06":9,"grade-07":8,"grade-08":9},"magic":{"grade":8.875,"given":6.875,"feedback":1,"smart":-8.8415711251583,"cool":93.435318430231}},"104812":{"id":104812,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":101318,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-13T01:19:08Z","created":"2018-08-09T11:14:04Z","modified":"2018-08-13T01:19:08Z","version":322571,"slug":"d-i-e","name":"d.i.e","body":"a bullet hell survival game","meta":{"author":[101318],"grade-05-out":"1","grade-06-out":"1","link-01":"https://particlect.itch.io/die","link-01-tag":"42337","link-01-name":"gem"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/d-i-e","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":0,"magic":{"cool":0,"feedback":0,"given":0,"grade":0,"smart":0}},"104815":{"id":104815,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":104813,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-12T22:32:11Z","created":"2018-08-09T11:15:43Z","modified":"2018-08-12T22:32:11Z","version":320052,"slug":"running-out-of-space-16","name":"Running out of Space","body":"This is my first LD.

It will turn \n    red otherwise.\n- Each successful box placed inside will give you 10 points, try to get as many points as possible.\n- The boxes is color coded based on size. Red is big box, Blue is medium box, Green is small box.\n- You can stack smaller boxes on top of bigger boxes, but not the other way around. And you can not stack boxes of same \n    size on top of eachother.\n\nKnown bugs:\n\n- If you try to place a box on a tile, but your mouse is hovering over other boxes, it will not place the box where you \n    want it, and most likely put it back where you picked it up from.\n\nTools used:\n\n- Unity /w JetBrains Rider\n- Bfxr\n- Snippingtool :)\n\n![Skjermbilde3.PNG](///raw/559/9/z/166a7.png)","meta":{"author":[39253],"cover":"///content/559/9/z/1663f.png","link-01":"https://mrmokka.itch.io/housemover","link-01-tag":"42337","link-02":"https://mrmokka.itch.io/housemover","link-02-tag":"42332"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/housemover","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":0,"grade":{"grade-01":4,"grade-02":4,"grade-03":4,"grade-04":4,"grade-05":4,"grade-06":3,"grade-07":4,"grade-08":4},"magic":{"cool":114.20804814403,"feedback":0,"given":3.75,"grade":3.875,"smart":-1.6261246324071}},"104844":{"id":104844,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":104789,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-12T22:57:03Z","created":"2018-08-09T11:57:21Z","modified":"2018-08-12T22:57:03Z","version":321062,"slug":"nightmare","name":"Nightmare","body":"Are you afreid of the nightmares?

It is our first submission to the jam. The theme of the jam is \"running out of space\".\n\n\n### Story:\n\nAfter the universe has collapsed, a big black hole arose. Planets were shattered into small pieces and are attracted by the black hole. If the pieces won't get assembled to planets by a space master, they will be lost. Your task is to assemble the pieces back together, before the black hole can strike.\n\n\n### Game objective:\n\nYou have to put pieces from the same planet (same texture) together. If you put together 5 pieces (20 tiles) from the same planet and they touch each other the planet is assembled and disappears. When the planet is assembled, you get a point for every tile that touches the tile of another piece, so fit them together without creating any holes.\n\nThe black hole strikes if you didn't place a piece fast enough. When it strikes, it takes away your space and every piece that was placed on that space. So keep in mind to place your pieces fast enough.\n\n\n### Controls:\n\nMoving the active block: wasd or arrow keys\nRotating the active block: q (left), e (right)\nLock the active block to its current place: space\n\nPlay sound: u\nPause sound: i\nVolume: o (up), p (down)\nNext track: j\n\n\n### Used Frameworks:\n\n- libgdx\n- piskel\n- gimp\n- abundant music","meta":{"author":[104900,113960,113962],"cover":"///content/4c9/91/z/17c13.png","link-01":"https://nenasdev.itch.io/master-the-space","link-01-tag":"42336","link-02":"https://nenasdev.itch.io/master-the-space","link-02-tag":"42512","link-02-name":"Java jar","link-03":"https://nenasdev.itch.io/master-the-space","link-03-tag":"42337"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/master-the-space","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":4,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T21:21:35Z","grade":{"grade-01":6,"grade-02":5,"grade-03":6,"grade-04":6,"grade-05":5,"grade-06":6,"grade-07":6,"grade-08":6},"magic":{"grade":5.75,"given":6.5,"feedback":4,"smart":21.583751774866,"cool":116.97953037312}},"104915":{"id":104915,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":90832,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-13T12:41:24Z","created":"2018-08-09T13:43:00Z","modified":"2018-08-13T13:01:56Z","version":325630,"slug":"eggstra-space","name":"Eggstra Space","body":"![egg.png](///raw/0d2/61/z/176b7.png)![egg2.png](///raw/0d2/61/z/176b8.png)![egg3.png](///raw/0d2/61/z/176ba.png)\n\n​Hello!

The last game I did during LD41 (Compo) was a total mess. I didn't manage to follow my plan. This was mainly due to randomly implementing things. I started writing a feature and in the middle of it went to start on another one (because it maybe was somehow related or cooler). Well the result like I said a total mess. This time it worked out a lot better. The core game was done at around half time. Then I carried on implementing some additional features I had in mind right from the start. This also worked out, just one mechanic was changed completely around 5 hours before submission. I was also able to add sounds and a menu this time which was missing completely from LD41.\nIn general I am fairly happy with the result. Although it is not the greatest idea I do like it and enjoyed play testing quite a bit :).\n\n## Day 1\nI started out by writing down what came to my mind. Instantly I though of Super Hexagen. Also storage on hard drives, in parking garages and warehouses came to mind. I did follow a thought about trash cans and keeping the environment clean, but then went on to use the warehouse idea. At first it was suppose to be a kinda endless runner (doodle jump style) where boxses stack up and you follow them to infinity. However I thought this was to basic. While the idea that I finally took is not really that more complex I still think it is something different.\nI began by first implementing the basic player controls. As its a cube/box I wanted to do it using physics so it's a lot of wiggly and twisty movements. That was done fairly quick, jumping was another thing. Although the first iteration was already quite close to how it is now, I iterated many times over it. Then I proceeded to get the spawner done. The amount and area where they spawn can all be modified from the inspector. They are calculated once at the start. After finishing the spawner I made a quick and small UI to keep track of the score and the yet to be implemented top barrier. Then (what a suprise) I proceeded to create that barrier. Basically the boxes are not allowed to stack up and reach the barrier. Cause else the storage is full. That was also done quite fast and only got one iteration over the day, because I needed to keep track of multiple objects crossing the line.\nThe rest of day 1 I actually went ahead and prepared some basic models. Designing the general outline of the scene. The player was then fully designed, as well as the other boxes to kick off the shelf. Also made some texture variations using Substance to give it a bit of diversity.\nThat was it mostly for day 1.\n\n## Day 2\nDay 2 I started out by creating the power ups. As the core game was basically done I went ahead and used the time to implement this because I felt like there was enough time. There was, but I did realize I got a bit more hectic while coding, so some things are done a bit dirty now. So note to myself stay structured until the end :P. I proceeded to finalize the scene and added a manu and gameover scene. Also added some sounds I recoreded on the site using some old cardboard boxes I had lying around. Those also made it into the final build, so I got some sound going on. Background music/sound is sadly just some nice. I did attempt a few melodies, but I am just way to bad at making music. I tweaked a lot of the settings and added a few more things in some scripts to kinda 'polish' the whole experience. Finally I needed some camera movement and used Cinemachine for that. Worked out great. I like it so much that I also used it for one thing in the menu :). Did some lighting and also some post processing to give the game a nice look. Several hours before the submission I tried the first build which failed (oh no the horrors), but it was just due to some random asset I didnt even use. Removed it and the build went through! Tweaked some of the unity settings and done was a proper build with most settings already in place.\n\n# Software Used:\n|Use|Software|\n|------|---|\n|Engine|Unity|\n|Models|Blender|\n|Textures|Affinity Designer/Photo & Substance Designer|\n|Audio|Audacity & Rytmik Studio|\n|Scripts|Visual Studio Code|\n\n\n# Build Updates (due to game breaking bugs)\n- New version was uploaded due to a game breaking bug (see 2nd comment), causing the main game scene (not the menu) to be mostly black.

I was really lost with the theme in this one. *Running Out of Space* gave me ideas about making some kind of illness-infested village where the player gradually gets overcrowded by sick villagers and it's a struggle to survive. Meanwhile, my friend suggested a runner game where the player would be trying to escape a collapsing mine: also running out of space. Lots of ideas were thrown around, but eventually I came up with a 2D hitman game where you could never step where you've already been, slightly inspired by HITMAN GO, and obviously by the HITMAN series of games. At first the game was meant to include the ability to poison your targets and set up traps, but after realizing the time constraints I chose to focus the game entirely around a simplified range of mechanics, and I think working within the limits of my own game when designing the levels was a very fun challenge on its own!\n\nI really hope you enjoy the game as much as I loved making it, and can leave me some feedback while you're at it. Enjoy Ludum Dare 42, everyone!\n\n![Screenshot_1.png](///raw/6b3/d/z/16f9b.png)\n\n![Screenshot_3.png](///raw/6b3/d/z/16fa0.png)\n\n![Screenshot_2.png](///raw/6b3/d/z/16fa1.png)\n\n![Screenshot_5.png](///raw/6b3/d/z/16fa2.png)\n\n![Screenshot_6.png](///raw/6b3/d/z/16fa4.png)\n\n![Screenshot_8.png](///raw/6b3/d/z/16fa5.png)\n\n![Screenshot_7.png](///raw/6b3/d/z/16fa6.png)\n\n![Screenshot_9.png](///raw/6b3/d/z/16fa8.png)","meta":{"author":[54198],"allow-anonymous-comments":"1","link-01-tag":"42336","link-01":"https://niker107.itch.io/ld42","link-02":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/549f9ue8kxrybd2/hitmangame.capx?dl=1","link-02-tag":"42332","cover":"///content/6b3/d/z/16f9f.png"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/hitman-the-floor-is-lava","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":1,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T17:34:38Z","grade":{"grade-01":1,"grade-02":1,"grade-03":1,"grade-04":1,"grade-05":1,"grade-06":1,"grade-07":1,"grade-08":1},"magic":{"cool":93.541434669349,"feedback":1,"given":0.875,"grade":1,"smart":17.260393995586}},"105010":{"id":105010,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":36831,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-13T18:52:08Z","created":"2018-08-09T15:11:54Z","modified":"2018-08-13T19:04:39Z","version":328918,"slug":"zombies-hate-fire","name":"Zombies Hate Fire...","body":"In this highly original zombie survival game you must stay alive long enough to get rescued, but that won't be easy as the rescue fire has also attracted the undead who will stop at nothing to eat your brains and put out the fire.\n\nControls\n\t* WASD to move around\n\t* Left click to fire an arrow\n\t* Right click to pick up material, crates, and barrels\n\t* Spacebar to jump\n\nGoal: Survive long enough for the rescue meter to fill up.

You have limited space on your truck for pickups, and a time limit before your shift ends. It may sound easy, but you lose money for every car you smash into, and it just happens to be rush hour! See how much money you can make (or lose!) before the end of the day!\n\nThe theme is incorporated in a few ways. For one, you have limited space on your truck for pickups. No-brainer. Two, there are a LOT of cars on the road, and the roads themselves are fairly narrow, giving you very limited space to move around. And on a smaller level, you've got to stop to pick up/drop off packages, so you need to time your stops carefully and not run out of space to stop.\n\nMusic and sound effects were made by my good friend, picoVolt.

This is my first ever Ludum Dare and this is also my first solo game I've done (both art and programming).  The result has been a bit rushed in order to meet the deadline and thankfully I have finished +-2 hours ahead of the deadline. \n\nGotta be honest: The game is *crap*. This was mostly done for fun and give myself a challenge over the weekend. I got an idea from the theme and I did it (to some degree, stuff was cut, including a narrative to explain the context of the game), so I can rest assured that I did it and I did on time. \n\nThings I would change: - The visuals, I wish I could've worked on the visuals more, I feel it's a part that also needs polish, but I wanted to get the working product, the gameplay because that was my weakest point since I pretty much I don't have a background doing programming, so that was my Nº1 priority.\n\nThe gameplay - Thing is, when you die in the game, the object gets fully destroyed and I was trying to figure out (even asked a friend, who lended me a hand to figure out stuff in the later part of the jam) how to stop it from moving + displaying a death screen UI, and since I couldn't, I just ended up doing a restart level button you can see in the top right corner, which I do not like, but it has it's purpose. And I almost didn't also get that to work on time, but I did!\n\nBut in the end, I loved doing this, I knew this would be fun. I just wish I had prepared more code beforehand to implement  and work with and have a better understanding of C#.\n\n\nSo yeah, nothing much else to say.

You have to evade Spacerocks and even other planets to get to jumpboosts which let you get further away from the blackhole.\n\nThere are 2 powerups in the game: the jumpboost (which lets you jump away from the blackhole, destroying every rock and planet you touch in your path) and the shield (which shields you for 3 seconds from any rocks and planets).\n\nIt's an endless game, with slightly increasing difficulty overtime, and different difficulties per character. The goal is to get a score as high as possible. You get points for every second survived, and for every rock/planet destroyed with your shield/jump. If you destroy multiple rocks/planets in a single jump, you get a score multiplier for that jump. Jumps can be chained (with a bit of skill and a lot of luck!).\n\nHope you enjoy ^.^\n","meta":{"author":[45445,105220,109761],"link-01-tag":"42337","cover":"///content/581/b/z/17941.jpg","link-01":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PDDlHeYMp6_o4cQ7PBtWnyi5qTBlogJI","link-01-name":"The game"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/crispys-planetary-survival","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":6,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T18:41:00Z","grade":{"grade-01":10,"grade-02":10,"grade-03":10,"grade-04":10,"grade-05":10,"grade-06":10,"grade-07":8,"grade-08":9},"magic":{"grade":9.625,"given":5,"feedback":3,"smart":-17.821859638668,"cool":76.138698762688}},"105211":{"id":105211,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":105210,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-13T06:52:48Z","created":"2018-08-09T18:16:03Z","modified":"2018-08-13T22:34:04Z","version":333552,"slug":"fyrewall","name":"Fyrewall","body":"Viruses have overrun the server rooms and you are running out of space!\n\nCONTROLS: Use WASD keys to move\n          Use the 'F' key to activate devices\n          Use Spacebar to jump over Viruses\n\nRace against the clock to survive! \nCan you survive against the quickly enclosing room to make it to the next level?\n\n![level.jpg](///raw/afa/91/z/182a7.jpg)\n\nCollect AntiVirus FloppyDisks to fight back!\n\n![floppy.jpg](///raw/afa/91/z/182ab.jpg)\n\n![gamepeg 3.jpg](///raw/afa/91/z/182ac.jpg)\n\n![gamepeg 2.jpg](///raw/afa/91/z/182ae.jpg)\n\nTwo whole levels to test your skills on!\n\n![gamepeg 4.jpg](///raw/afa/91/z/182b1.jpg)\n\n![gamepeg 5.jpg](///raw/afa/91/z/18310.jpg)","meta":{"author":[105210,109243],"link-01-tag":"42337","allow-anonymous-comments":"1","link-01":"https://makbeard.itch.io/fyrewall","cover":"///content/bba/a1/z/17c34.png"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/fyrewall","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":0,"magic":{"cool":0,"feedback":0,"given":0,"grade":0,"smart":0}},"105227":{"id":105227,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":105163,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-12T17:59:41Z","created":"2018-08-09T18:27:22Z","modified":"2018-08-13T14:24:53Z","version":326179,"slug":"utter-space","name":"Utter Space","body":"![space_gif.gif](///raw/bca/91/z/16144.gif)\n\n![sh3.png](///raw/bca/91/z/16257.png)\n\n![sh1.png](///raw/bca/91/z/16258.png)\n\n![sh2.png](///raw/bca/91/z/1625b.png)\n\n![15888.gif](///raw/bca/91/z/164d8.gif)\n\nThe space is getting pretty crowded.

Ludum Dare number 12, for me. I'll admit, I nearly forgot about this one, causing it to become a 24-hour challenge. Nevertheless, here is my complete (no music) entry, all prepared for you to (hopefully) enjoy!\n\nIn this entry, you are managing a hotel during a busy tourist season. Your whole business revolves around your guests' reviews on popular fictional travel website 'journeyassistant'. If your guests are satisfied, they'll leave you with a positive review. However, if the crowds of tourists flooding into your hotel can't get a room, as your hotel will be constantly RUNNING OUT OF SPACE, they'll leave you a negative review. Enough of those, and you'll be out of business!\n\nExpand your hotel by adding floors, hire plenty of staff, and hopefully, all of your guests will leave satisfied!\n\nThe game is entirely mouse driven, and you can use the scroll wheel when your hotel starts to grow larger. If you don't have a mouse wheel, the UP and DOWN arrow keys also work.\n\nThe game has quite a slow start, but after about 5 minutes or so, it should start to pick up and become more interesting. Either way, this is supposed to be more of a chill, run-in-the-background game.\n\nAnd yes, the hotel can technically be built up infinitely (although some code changes will need to be made for that, I didn't have quite enough time to implement true infinity).\n\nNo music again this time (I only had 24 hours!), so plug in your favourite tunes, sit back, relax, and enjoy my game!\n\nThanks!\n\n![screen1.png](///raw/2aa/1/z/16afb.png)![screen2.png](///raw/2aa/1/z/16afc.png)![screen3.png](///raw/2aa/1/z/17031.png)","meta":{"author":[6818],"grade-06-out":"1","link-01-tag":"42332","link-01":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/scbx40udgxpjadr/LD42%20Infinite%20Hotel%20Source.rar?dl=0","link-01-name":"Source Code","link-02":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/ww9gn2733uigc2t/LD42%20Infinite%20Hotel.rar?dl=0","link-02-tag":"42337","link-02-name":"Java","cover":"///content/2aa/1/z/16ae7.png"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/the-infinite-hotel","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":0,"magic":{"cool":0,"feedback":0,"given":0,"grade":0,"smart":0}},"105246":{"id":105246,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":105243,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-13T01:09:41Z","created":"2018-08-09T18:40:37Z","modified":"2018-08-13T21:47:11Z","version":332559,"slug":"crumble","name":"Crumble","body":"Crumble is a platformer game, you have 2 minutes to stay alive.\n\nWASD = Movement\n\nSpace bar = Jump\n\nMouse = Look\n\nWe have updated the game following your feedbacks.\n\nIf your game suffer some lags, please consider downloading the Exe file for PC or MAC\n\nThe web version is a preview of the real game, play the exe version if you want the full experience.\n![TitleV1.png](///raw/b1b/91/z/17110.png)\n\n![menu01.png](///raw/b1b/91/z/17109.png)\n\n![Gif01.gif](///raw/b1b/91/z/17115.gif)\n\n![Capture03.JPG](///raw/b1b/91/z/17108.jpg)\n\n\n\n","meta":{"author":[105243,104904],"grade-06-out":"1","allow-anonymous-comments":"1","cover":"///content/b1b/91/z/17f17.png","link-01":"https://anstabo.itch.io/crumble","link-01-tag":"42337","link-02":"https://anstabo.itch.io/crumble","link-02-tag":"42336","link-03":"https://anstabo.itch.io/crumble","link-03-tag":"42339"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/crumble","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":44,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T22:50:31Z","grade":{"grade-01":46,"grade-02":46,"grade-03":46,"grade-04":46,"grade-05":47,"grade-07":45,"grade-08":46},"magic":{"grade":46,"given":56.5,"feedback":42,"smart":19.16375287813,"cool":119.97876669894}},"105250":{"id":105250,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":105242,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-13T19:41:03Z","created":"2018-08-09T18:44:55Z","modified":"2018-08-13T19:41:03Z","version":329489,"slug":"closing-arena-1","name":"Closing Arena","body":"2D arena fighting game, with an arena that is constantly shrinking.","meta":{"author":[105242,105231],"link-01-tag":"42337","grade-08-out":"1","grade-06-out":"1","link-01":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rlbPiRxyADjmxxKF6z_0DdnuX_XKqiz4"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/closing-arena-1","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":0,"magic":{"cool":106.06601717798,"feedback":0,"given":1.125,"grade":0,"smart":6.0660171779821}},"105253":{"id":105253,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":105251,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-12T19:19:09Z","created":"2018-08-09T18:45:57Z","modified":"2018-08-12T20:00:38Z","version":316034,"slug":"ice-sheet-meltdown","name":"Ice Sheet Meltdown","body":"A game where you play as an alien on an unstable ice sheet.

You are a penguin on a melting ice floe . You have to fight against other penguins for the remaining and slowly shrinking space. You can walk on the slippery surface and use jump attacks to kick other penguin out of the platform. Only the most adapted penguins will remain and adaption means, be the last one on the floe. The game was created during the 48 hour game jam ludum dare 42.\n\nThe political message behind this: Stop the climate change! It is real! The penguins are running out of space, their habitat is vanishing!

But let's be a sensible dragon here; If you can't stuff more stuff in your horde, try swapping out some items for better ones at the local monster swap meet.  Better hurry though, you only have 5 days before the editors will be here to judge your horde.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty simple, you need to swap items with other monsters by exploiting their likes an dislikes.  Some things are obvious (demons like cursed items), but others are less obvious.  You can talk to monsters to learn more about that monster and others.  Additionally, you are a magic creature and can get a perk each day to help you with swapping or to magically enhance what you have.\n\nControls:\nDirectional buttons or digital pad on controller to move around menus\nSpace or A Button on controller to select the currently highlighted option or to advance text.\n\nConstructive Criticize is always encouraged, and if you complete the game, let me know your final score.

All I could envision was a match three with an ever shrinking play area. To keep it fun, it starts out fairly simple (3 dots, 3 colors), but it gets harder each level (max 5 dots and 8 colors). As it stands, this all me. I designed the game, wrote the code, made the 3D and 2D art, and just for giggles this time I made all my own sounds using nothing but my mouth, an African drum, and a Logitech headset with Audacity. However, since sounds are really a matter of taste, there is a full customization menu to turn of any or all the sounds. You can even reset the local high score.\n\nTomorrow is the first day of Back to School for teachers like me, so I won't be working any more on this tomorrow unless I get off a bit early on the first day. If I do, I will try to implement worldwide leader boards using Dreamlo. I have used it before, but it has been a while. Besides, I need to get familiar with it again so I can show my students how to use it. :^)\n\nSo in case I don't get back to this before the deadline, I give you Quadrata Minima (Latin for Minimal Square). I hope you have fun playing it, because I had a blast making it!

It was an awesome learning experience and tons of fun, we look forward to participating again in December :) Even though we did not finish (or really even get to making) a game, we have the basis of a prototype for an interesting city-builder/disaster-management game that we will build upon moving forward.\n\n# The Dream\nBay Area Traffic: Disaster Simulator was intended to be a game about managing traffic, resources, and people as ocean levels continue to rise and threaten the Bay Area. The game would begin with a normal simulation, but rising water would begin to flood and then destroy city tiles, killing all the residents unless you successfully evacuate them to another, safer location in time. As time progressed, you would be forced to make decisions about which cities to save, where to send your emergency evac crews, and where to spend your resources to most efficiently improve the flow of traffic. Meanwhile, citizens would go about their normal daily life, oblivious to the crisis at hand. By the end of the game, most tiles would be flooded and you would be scored based on how many people you saved.\n\n# Reality\nUnfortunately, these were just dreams. The current game is merely a tech demo, featuring a procedurally generated Bay Area with a functioning traffic prototype.\n\n# Controls\n\n## WASD / Arrow Keys - Pan Camera\n## Mouse Scrolls Wheel - Zoom Camera\n## Mouse Click - Select cars \n\n![Screen Shot 2018-08-12 at 10.51.52 PM.png](///raw/f35/6/z/174b4.png)\n![Screen Shot 2018-08-13 at 12.24.23 AM.png](///raw/f35/6/z/174b0.png)\n![Screen Shot 2018-08-13 at 12.24.35 AM.png](///raw/f35/6/z/174a9.png)\n![Screen Shot 2018-08-13 at 12.16.08 AM.png](///raw/f35/6/z/174ae.png)\n","meta":{"author":[25919,113069],"allow-anonymous-comments":"1","grade-06-out":"1","cover":"///content/f35/6/z/17407.png","link-01":"https://github.com/Jacobingalls/bay-area-traffic-simulator","link-01-tag":"50","link-02":"https://dxk2294.itch.io/bay-area-traffic-sim","link-02-tag":"42337","link-03":"https://dxk2294.itch.io/bay-area-traffic-sim","link-03-tag":"42339","link-04":"https://dxk2294.itch.io/bay-area-traffic-sim","link-04-tag":"42341"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/bay-area-traffic-disaster-simulation","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":6,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T08:00:27Z","grade":{"grade-01":11,"grade-02":11,"grade-03":11,"grade-04":11,"grade-05":11,"grade-07":8,"grade-08":8},"magic":{"grade":10.142857142857,"given":8.625,"feedback":1,"smart":-5.1502299779307,"cool":104.65362369446}},"105771":{"id":105771,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":105764,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-13T21:32:12Z","created":"2018-08-10T04:54:47Z","modified":"2018-08-13T21:32:12Z","version":332173,"slug":"volcano-escape","name":"Volcano Escape","body":"A simple platformer where the player is constantly chased by rising lava.","meta":{"author":[105764,105754],"cover":"///content/42d/91/z/17d08.png","allow-anonymous-comments":"1","grade-07-out":"1","grade-06-out":"1","link-01-tag":"42337"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/volcano-escape","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":0,"magic":{"cool":0,"feedback":0,"given":0,"grade":0,"smart":0}},"105779":{"id":105779,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":69194,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-13T08:21:56Z","created":"2018-08-10T05:15:06Z","modified":"2018-08-13T08:21:56Z","version":324234,"slug":"evil-forest-battle","name":"Evil Forest Battle","body":"You are a wizard, and the village needs you!

We originally planned to make an story based futuristic RPG, with robots and androids (NPC) with each having a side quests, multiple areas (City, Wasteland), lots of trash (each area with it own set of trash, was gonna be very trashy, lol) etc.\nThis will probably be a minigame in the full version with another name, which we will finish up at an later date. More art was made but not added this time around. (Hope to add that in for the full version) but at least we managed to upload something!\n\nFor this theme we ended up making it an tilted 2D game. \nHow to play: \nSimple, you move around with arrow keys:\n\nUp ↑\t\nDown ↓\t\nRight →\t\nLeft ←\t\nor W, S, A, D\n\nObjective:\nYou play as the main character, Zero (and only one for now, lol) and have have to go around with his classywalk (lol) and gather as much orbs (points!) as possible, while trying to avoid the cacti. The sign gives no damage, so feel free to pass trough it. It will get harder to to as the space fills up with them (as seen in the pictures below). You can pass trough the cactus, but be aware that you will lose some HP! The bottle restores HP sightly. The Blue Orb give 10 points while the purple on, 100.\n\nCactus - Damage/Lose HP\n\nSign - No Damage\n\nBottle - Restores HP Sightly\n\nBlue Orb - 10 points\n\nPurple Orb - 100 points\n\n![153406426633200587.jpg](///raw/12f/11/z/15d06.jpg)\n\n\n\nHave fun, and would be nice to get some feedback and possibly ideas for both this minigame and the full game, memes references are welcome if you got an idea related to that, as well as items and characters and story related to them that might fit the setting >.O\n\n*We will put your name in the credits if we end up using your idea. >.O\n\nAnd feel free to share your score in the comment section, would be nice to know how everyone did! ( ᐛ )و\n\nTo Do: Complete city + possibly make 2 more city areas, NPCs (4 robots, 2 types from each gen), complete heroine, 3 extra NPCs for side quest ++ maybe more later, feel free to give idea for thing to make to.\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: As good as everything is created from scratch, exluding the music, which is by Miyuu (Royalty Free). We hope you enjoy this minigame!

And remember even if you run out of space, there's always something you can do to help.\n\nWhy I made this game.\n\nI wanted to bring to light the recent immigrant crisis, but without sounding overly political. So I chose to blend sadness and humor within a minimalistic experience. Exodus Terminus is somewhat of a mockery on how the news portrays immigrants and refugees as just another person with a sad face. How even a few of your choices and actions can completely change the future of a nation and it's people. I hope I've contributed something worthwhile.

Also, if one key cap is removed ,it is broken too.\nRemember, if he is concentrating on playing computer games, you can't break the keyboard, or his anger value will increase. If his anger value is max, you will lose. So you should distract him by clicking on \"Click this guy\" button or giving him hamburgers. You even can turn of the light to make him blind.

You can only walk on pizza so you need to defend it.\nIf the pizza gets too small, you will have no are to move on, and you will most certainly get eaten. \n\nUnimplemented ideas:\n- You win after a certan amount of waves. \n- If you kill the zombie ingredients, they become normal. And if you get a certain amount of needed normal ingredients, than you win the level. (Missions style)\n- If a zombie that does not eat pizza gets to the Basilic Braga(basilics name.. Don't ask), you lose. \n\n![screen3.png](///raw/7d8/d/z/17606.png)\n\nPS: Its my first time, so there were a lot of unclear rules and submission uncertanties..\n\n#### Controls:\n- WASD to move\n- Mouse to aim\n- Space or mouse click to shoot.

[Download executable](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1djje2y9laf3c7l/PizzaDefender_fixed_exe.rar?dl=0) for best experience! ..or fire using \"Space\".\n\n\nGame was made from scratch using:\nPhotoshop. hand drawn and animated.\nFlashDevelop for coding (no engine whatsoever. basic actionscript3). Didnt use AS3 for a long time. This was a bit of a bad idea.\nFlash IDE - just because I was lazy to import some images using FlashDevelop.\nNo sound :( didn't succeed to. too little time :(\n\n![CherryTomatoWalk.gif](///raw/7d8/d/z/17486.gif)\n\nI wasted time drawing and animating 3 aditional monsters that I didnt get to include (though they were 80-90% finished)..

(forgot there was an aditional hour to submit the game).

There's a bug when the pizza bites are squared instead of toothmarked!!!!!!!! :(((\nAlso didn't get to finish the deathScreen :). if you die, you need to close and restart the game. Should I change it afterwise? can I? Its some trivial bs..\n**Update:** I will have 2 versions linked.\n\n\n#### Important:\nThe download version is made within Compo time restrictions (for me until 1:00 AM).\nIn the itch.io version I corrected a fiew minor bugs after the timelimit.\nThere will always be a link to the original(compo restricted) version!\n\n## Enjoy!!!\n","meta":{"author":[55511],"link-01-tag":"42336","allow-anonymous-comments":"1","cover":"///content/7d8/d/z/17614.png","link-02-tag":"42337","link-03-tag":"42337","link-01":"https://sloyd.itch.io/pizza-defender","link-02":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/1djje2y9laf3c7l/PizzaDefender_fixed_exe.rar?dl=0","link-02-name":"Executable Fixed","link-03":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/iiunakvg7aklymc/PizzaDefender_executable.rar?dl=0","link-03-name":"Executable Original","link-01-name":"HTML itch.io","link-04":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/w4enhms6lo5dqcd/src.rar?dl=0","link-04-tag":"42332","link-04-name":"Src","grade-06-out":"1"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/pizza-defender","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":27,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T18:00:00Z","grade":{"grade-01":24,"grade-02":25,"grade-03":24,"grade-04":23,"grade-05":25,"grade-06":13,"grade-07":24,"grade-08":22},"magic":{"grade":25.714285714286,"given":20,"feedback":5,"smart":-6.4585653306515,"cool":96.448564434082}},"107292":{"id":107292,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":106982,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-12T03:24:31Z","created":"2018-08-10T19:15:36Z","modified":"2018-08-12T03:42:20Z","version":311576,"slug":"delusional-thoughts","name":"Delusional Thoughts","body":"Fast paced arcade action game play with and interesting scoring mechanic.

Things I used:\n\n- [Phaser](https://phaser.io)\n- [Javascript](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm)\n- [bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net) for the sounds\n- [Pixen](http://pixenapp.com) for the pixelmess\n- [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) for coding\n- webpack and yarn and such for packing and building and things\n- Affinity Designer for the shitty cover image\n\n### What went well\n\nI did finish and submit my first game to a game jam. I actually finished this thing. It has a start, a playable part and an end. Usually I loose interest and chicken out, when I have my basic interactions going. The \"art\" is pretty shitty, but I don't hate it.\n\n### What went not so well\n\nI decided to participate half an hour before ludum dare startet. I had other stuff to do this weekend. And even when I had time to work on the project, it was quite hard to remain focused during the day.\n\nI startet playing with rytimik studio for some music, but I hated what I came up with. So there's no music.

Position your truck in front of a home to collect its waste. A meter will fill above the truck to show how full it is, and when the meter is full, you will no longer be able to pick things up until you go back to the dump and wait for the truck to empty.\n\nYou will have to plot a course that allows you to regularly hit each home — if you allow trash to accumulate too much, the residents will start submitting complaints against you. When a home is getting near that limit, a yellow \"!\" will appear above it.\n\nTry to gather as much trash as you can before the complaints pile up!\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTools Used:\n\nUnity3d 2018\n\nVisual Studio Community 2017\n\nMagicaVoxel\n\nBfxr\n\nMicrosoft Paint\n\nBeepBox (https://www.beepbox.co/)\n\n![Dumping.PNG](///raw/6b8/21/z/16955.png)\n![RunningOur.PNG](///raw/6b8/21/z/1695f.png)\n![GameOver.PNG](///raw/6b8/21/z/16961.png)","meta":{"author":[75958],"link-01-tag":"42336","allow-anonymous-comments":"1","cover":"///content/6b8/21/z/1661b.png","link-01":"https://ethanthebrave.itch.io/logistic-dumping","link-02-tag":"42332","link-02":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1i2q6ZQ53JFCevn6GX-A4nRj0WwT9X41Q"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/logistic-dumping","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":0,"grade":{"grade-01":1,"grade-02":1,"grade-03":1,"grade-04":1,"grade-05":1,"grade-06":1,"grade-07":1,"grade-08":1},"magic":{"cool":0,"feedback":0,"given":0,"grade":1,"smart":0}},"108197":{"id":108197,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":5151,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-13T08:13:15Z","created":"2018-08-10T21:46:30Z","modified":"2018-08-13T08:15:30Z","version":324206,"slug":"tetromatcher","name":"Tetromatcher","body":"Tetromatcher is a block-stacking game which features elements of Tetris and color-matching puzzle games.\n\nPost your highscores!\n\n## Controls\n\nMove left/right: arrow left/right\nFast drop: arrow down\nRotate right: space, X, F\nRotate left: Z, W, Y, Q\n\n## Rules\n\nBasic Tetris rules apply, with weaker scoring to encourage use of color matching chains.\n\nMatching 4 or more of one color clears only those blocks, and applies gravity only to the columns that were occupied.

The first thing you notice in this modern city is that there's nothing natural to be found. However, you manage to acquire the only piece of land left with nothing built on it. So you decide to create your own garden to bring some life to this soulless city.\n\n\n## HOW TO PLAY\n\nYour piece of land consists on a 10x10 grid and you can move from square to square in a first person view. You can sow a plant on each square, and after that you must water it regularly or else it will wither and die. You can sow other plants in other squares while the already existing plants are growing. Once a plant has fully grown into a tree, you won't need to water it anymore. Your objective is to grow the highest amount of trees that you can before the time runs out.\n\nBut be careful! If you step on a square that contains a plant, you will damage it and it will take longer to fully grow. Sometimes you will have to step on a plant in order to reach and water another plant. So plan carefully where do you start sowing you plants and watch your steps to avoid damaging your plants as much as you can. Fully grown trees, along with 10 random rocks scattered through the land will block your way. They can make things harder for you!\n\nThis is the cycle of a plant as long as you water it in time:\n- Nothing  ->   Seed planted   ->   Small plant   ->   Bush   ->   Tree\n\nIf you don't water the plant in time or if you step on it, it will go back one step as follows:\n- Bush   ->   Small plant   ->   Nothing\n\nRemember that trees won't die, and if a plant fully dies, you'll have to plant the seed again.\n\n\n## CONTROLS\n\n- W: Move Forward\n- S: Move Backward\n- A: Rotate Left\n- D: Rotate Right\n- Q: Strafe Left\n- E: Strafe Right\n- 1: Plant a seed\n- 2: Water the seed / plant","meta":{"author":[49354],"grade-06-out":"1","grade-07-out":"1","link-01-tag":"42337","cover":"///content/ac0/c/z/178a0.jpg","allow-anonymous-comments":"1","link-01":"https://pacochan.itch.io/city-gardener"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/city-gardener","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":4,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T20:39:20Z","grade":{"grade-01":6,"grade-02":6,"grade-03":6,"grade-04":6,"grade-05":6,"grade-08":6},"magic":{"grade":6,"given":3.125,"feedback":0,"smart":-27.831216351297,"cool":94.491118252307}},"108200":{"id":108200,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":108194,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-13T21:26:17Z","created":"2018-08-10T21:46:47Z","modified":"2018-08-13T21:33:56Z","version":332218,"slug":"dataskream","name":"DataSkream","body":"###DataSkream\n___\n\nWelcome to DataSkream, a game that will test your reflexes and awareness!

GitKraken was used so that we could all work collectively on the project at the same time.\n\n \n\n- Controls (PC)\nWASD for movement\nSPACE for Jump\n\n-Controls (Console Pad)\nLeft Analog for movement\nA Button for Jump\n\n- Used Tools:\nUnity\nMaya\nBlender\nPhotoshop\nGitKraken\nAbleton\nVisual Studio Code\nZBrush\n","meta":{"author":[108194,98757,9938,104871,113669],"allow-anonymous-comments":"1","link-01-tag":"42336","grade-08-out":"1","link-01":"https://sollara-games.itch.io/dataskream","link-02":"https://github.com/Flubz/LD42","link-02-tag":"42332"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/dataskream","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":0,"magic":{"cool":0,"feedback":0,"given":0,"grade":0,"smart":0}},"108210":{"id":108210,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":32713,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-12T16:50:32Z","created":"2018-08-10T21:47:47Z","modified":"2018-08-12T16:53:29Z","version":314349,"slug":"data-overload","name":"Data Overload","body":"Drop data cubes on the correct space.

Use the **SPACE** key to **jump and change direction** in mid air (or much rather vacuum). \nBut be careful, you have a **limited amount of jumps** available. You run out of jumps, and you go flying off into the depths of outer space. Lucky for you your jumps are **replenished whenever you land on an asteroid**.\nOn your way down you might encounter some strange objects. They are not really useful, except for the **COINS** which **give you extra jumps** and might save you from certain death.\n\nAnyway, have fun playing and good luck getting back to earth (the destination will have been worth the journey).\n\n![MainMenu.png](///raw/03a/z/16938.png)\n\n![InGame.png](///raw/03a/z/1693b.png)","meta":{"author":[2608,104118],"link-01-tag":"42337","allow-anonymous-comments":"1","cover":"///content/03a/z/16933.png","link-01-name":"GitHub","link-01":"https://github.com/NavCon/GargleBlaster/releases/tag/v1.0"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/gargleblaster","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":0,"grade":{"grade-01":1,"grade-02":1,"grade-03":1,"grade-04":1,"grade-05":1,"grade-06":1,"grade-07":1,"grade-08":1},"magic":{"grade":1,"given":0,"feedback":0,"smart":0,"cool":0}},"108438":{"id":108438,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":51313,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-12T15:17:37Z","created":"2018-08-10T22:08:43Z","modified":"2018-08-12T17:36:22Z","version":314644,"slug":"super-squash","name":"Super Squash!","body":"Super Squash! - Compo entry for LDJAM42\n\nYou play twins farmers, trying not to get squashed by their environment!\n\n**Gamepad is recommended**\n\n*Move around usind LEFT and RIGHT stick (WASD + arrow keys).*\n\nPush Boxes.\n\n**And most important: Don't get Squashed!**\n\n​Can you make it?\n\n![1.png](///raw/178/c/z/15f7a.png)\n![2.png](///raw/178/c/z/15f7b.png)\n\n\n\n\nFinished within about 19 hours of work.\n\n*Site includes HTML5, Windows EXE and Compo required Source Code!*","meta":{"author":[51313],"grade-07-out":"1","link-01":"https://dokalfar.itch.io/super-squash-ldjam-42","link-01-tag":"50","link-01-name":"Game Maker 2","link-02":"https://dokalfar.itch.io/super-squash-ldjam-42","link-02-tag":"42336","link-02-name":"HTML5 (web)","link-03":"https://dokalfar.itch.io/super-squash-ldjam-42","link-03-tag":"42337","link-03-name":"Windows"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/super-squash","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":3,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T13:38:33Z","grade":{"grade-01":4,"grade-02":4,"grade-03":4,"grade-04":4,"grade-05":4,"grade-06":4,"grade-08":3},"magic":{"grade":3.8571428571429,"given":3,"feedback":1,"smart":-4.742065558432,"cool":112.3902973898}},"108451":{"id":108451,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":6727,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-12T21:45:13Z","created":"2018-08-10T22:09:52Z","modified":"2018-08-12T21:45:13Z","version":317989,"slug":"wild-warehouse","name":"Wild Warehouse","body":"You're in charge of a warehouse with wares coming in daily and some wares leaving everyday.\n\n![WildWarehouse1.png](///raw/74a/1/z/1674a.png)\n\nGoal is to get everything in  to the warehouse, and all the orders out!​ and watch the clock...\n\n\nControls:\nWASD/Arrows: Move character 8-directional\nSpacebar: Pickup / Put down\nLeft-Shift: Stop rotation (Hold)\n\n\nCAUTION!

If you've played a space game like Kerbal Space Program or Lunar Lander, it will be familiar. If not, [this video](https://youtu.be/eOMS8Y3ULdY?list=PLYu7z3I8tdEmqpOkQZCl5SZB5t0vXuxE0&t=295) talks about a similar landing in KSP. But the basic idea is that if you burn facing away from your current heading you will slow down, and if you slow down your orbit will get lower.\n\nThe camera in this game is always oriented so that the planet is beneath you, so down on the screen is the direction of gravity, and the direction you will need to go to reach land.\n\nYour UI from left to right is:\n\nALT (altitude): Your altitude with maximum being your starting altitude, and minimum being sea level of the planet (note that terrain can be higher than sea level!)\n\nVEL (velocity): Your current heading relative to your viewpoint. If the yellow line is facing right, then you are going clockwise around the planet. If it's facing down, you're heading straight for the surface!\n\nORBIT: A simple map of your position relative to the planet. This view is not adjusted to your perspective.\n\nLVL (level): The current level you're on.\n\nSCORE: How many points you've earned. You earn points for each level you beat, and the more fuel you have left over the more points you earn.\n\nGAS: The amount of fuel left in your current stage. The booster and lander have separate fuel reserves, but the lander has much less, so use it wisely.\n\nControls:\n\nA/D or left arrow/right arrow - Rotate counterclockwise/clockwise\n\nW or up arrow - Thrust\n\nSpace or return - separate the lander from the booster\n\nEscape - return to the main menu","meta":{"author":[12156],"cover":"///content/c7f/2/z/15fd6.png","grade-07-out":"1","link-01":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/iq6rpf00urvdtj6/ld42_return_to_garbage_world_src.zip?dl=0","link-01-tag":"42332","link-02":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/jndhxltcw2goyfg/ld42_return_to_garbage_world_win.zip?dl=0","link-02-tag":"42337"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/return-to-garbage-world","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":10,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T16:59:42Z","grade":{"grade-01":22,"grade-02":22,"grade-03":22,"grade-04":23,"grade-05":23,"grade-06":22,"grade-08":19},"magic":{"cool":116.26367179524,"feedback":19,"given":24.5,"grade":21.857142857143,"smart":24.721912892465}},"108554":{"id":108554,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":79270,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-11T04:56:16Z","created":"2018-08-10T22:28:55Z","modified":"2018-08-13T15:07:12Z","version":326456,"slug":"junk-dealer-running-out-of-space","name":"Junk dealer running out of space","body":"![logo.png](///raw/6a5/31/z/15726.png)\nno promises. just logo.\n\nYES!

You have to figure out ways to dispose of the boxes before your house is overrun. \n\nThere's a lot that I wanted to put in the game but didn't have time for, and there's only one way to get rid of the boxes, so you likely won't need to play the game very long to see everything in it's current state. Planned if I continue to work on the game, are things you, the player, can buy on the computer in the office to help get rid of the boxes (such as wood for your fireplace, some sort of shredder, etc.). The catch there would be that those items would come in boxes of their own, which you would have to weigh the cost of in terms of the space available in your house. Also I would want it to have something in the ui that shows how close you are to losing, but I didn't get around to it. There is a debug menu that shows how close you are to losing, though, if you want to see. I think it's a decent idea for a game and wanted to finish it, I just had other things come up that I needed to do and couldn't finish it.\n\n![screenshot-1.png](///raw/5a8/1/z/16c4f.png)\n\n![screenshot-2.png](///raw/5a8/1/z/16ca1.png)\n\n![screenshot-3.png](///raw/5a8/1/z/16ca3.png)\n\n![screenshot-4.png](///raw/5a8/1/z/16ca6.png)\n\n![screenshot-5.png](///raw/5a8/1/z/16ca8.png)\n\n### Controls\n- **WASD** to move\n- **Mouse** to move camera\n- **LMB** to pick up/drop boxes\n- **F** to fold boxes\n- **F3** to open/close the debug menu\n- **.** to spawn a bunch of boxes quickly (no actual gameplay purpose, just there if you want to see a bunch of boxes)\n\n### Tools\n- Unity 2018\n- Visual Studio Code\n- Blender / ProBuilder\n- PhotoShop\n\nI put a link to the source code, but it's not showing it for me, so here's the link: https://github.com/jasperarmstrong/LD42\n\nAlso, I was only able to test the Mac and Windows builds, but the Linux one should work fine too since it's a Unity game.

After a long time jamming again, and not being able to just stay 2 days straight working, and using new software, I had a rough start, but everything ended well 😄 So it was actually good for me to do forget about compo and do it in a slower pace in jam.\n\nNo BGM and no fancy art, but I think this game didn't ask for it, and I was able to make (mostly) everything by myself~ so it actually follows compo rules, except the time constraint!\n\nAnyway, that's it for me, I hope you enjoyed this small time playing my game, and as always, any feedback is much appreciated! 🙌\n__/**************************************************/__","meta":{"author":[6659],"cover":"///content/30a/1/z/178c3.png","link-01-tag":"50","link-01":"https://gitlab.com/nihilaleph/ld42","link-01-name":"Source Code","link-02-tag":"42337","link-02-name":"Itch.io (Windows)","link-02":"https://nihilaleph.itch.io/test-subject-42"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/test-subject-42","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":3,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T17:48:16Z","grade":{"grade-01":4,"grade-02":4,"grade-03":4,"grade-04":4,"grade-05":5,"grade-06":5,"grade-07":5,"grade-08":5},"magic":{"grade":4.5,"given":0,"feedback":0,"smart":-52.859547920897,"cool":0}},"108803":{"id":108803,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":56815,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-12T21:32:26Z","created":"2018-08-10T23:55:16Z","modified":"2018-08-12T21:32:26Z","version":317645,"slug":"tower-crunch","name":"Tower Crunch","body":"Instructions: Defend the tower against hordes of enemies.

We were not really inspired by the theme to be honest, and because we didn't want to create a game with a basic idea, we decided to create a game from the idea that inspired us the most.\n\nWe eventually made a game that we like and that allowed each one of us to learn things and experiment (which is great since we are students and want to keep on learning and discovering things in our main skill areas).

The machines have taken the control of the universe. Only a few groups of humans remain in the recondite corners of the space. After ages fighting against the machines, these has taken the control of a bunch numbers of human subjects. And the artificial intelligences are experiment with them; knowing their weakness; learning from their enemies. \n\nAfter the Future is a sci-fi videogame made in 72h by Jordi Garcia aka @bichodust for the Ludum Dare Jam 42. The theme was \"Running out of space\". In this context, you have to play with the different mechanics to analyze the human subjects and balance everything to have enough data space to keep doing it.\n\nThe mechanics will challenge your reflexes and micromanagement skills. While you are repeating a simple key patterns, you have to stay aware of the hard disk state; the model batteries; and the subject time. \n\nI made all the design, coding and art. For the music and sound effects, I have used royalty free resources from freesound.org and looperman.com.\n\nI would appreciate some feedback a lot. Hope you enjoy it :D!\n\n**Mechanic Rules:**\n\n- You have to analyse 10 human subjects. Each one remains 32 seconds maximum to you to do it.\n\n\n- Middle screen: Shows the key pattern you have to repeat (it refreshes every 3 seconds), to gain one analysing cell. When the bar is full, the human subject is analysed.\n\n\n- Left screen: It shows you the amount of space used in disk(white). Each subject analysed fill 2 cells. If you run out of space, the next subject will be disintegrated by the system and 2 cells of space will be freed.\n\n\n- Top right screen: It shows you the time remaining (white) of the current subject to be analysed.\n\n\n- Three little screen on right bottom: The boost has a percentage to fill all the subject bar or burn the current subject; the bolt fills one battery of the model XhJG48_X. If the robot runs out of energy, you have to wait a few seconds until he is working again; the file removes one cell of data from the hard disk.\n\n![S113 at 17.13.21 (2).png](///raw/829/a1/z/17848.png)\n\n![Screen Shot 2018-08-13 at 17.13.51 (2).png](///raw/829/a1/z/1784b.png)\n\n![Screen Shot 20asd13 at 17.13.51 (2) copy.png](///raw/829/a1/z/1784d.png)","meta":{"author":[108840],"link-01-tag":"42336","cover":"///content/829/a1/z/17823.png","grade-06-out":"1","link-01":"https://bichodust.itch.io/after-the-future","link-02-tag":"0","link-03-tag":"0","link-04-tag":"0","link-02":"","link-03":"","link-04":""},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/after-the-future","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":10,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T20:49:38Z","grade":{"grade-01":9,"grade-02":9,"grade-03":9,"grade-04":9,"grade-05":9,"grade-07":8,"grade-08":9},"magic":{"grade":8.8571428571429,"given":4.75,"feedback":2,"smart":-19.427452045557,"cool":83.887049280786}},"108860":{"id":108860,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":10332,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-12T17:35:45Z","created":"2018-08-11T00:20:47Z","modified":"2018-08-12T20:39:55Z","version":316595,"slug":"gone-in-dark-cave","name":"Gone in dark cave","body":"![cover.jpg](///raw/c58/2/z/1615a.jpg)\n\nYour enter the dark cave, a strange place with dark magic and weird monsters.\nWith your bag of cards, you have to defeat all the 5 floors to win.\n\nThe game is a card game, where every card you play and every hit you take go on board.

Good news is that the space station is fully automated and no one would really stop you from taking whatever you think might be useful, be it a fire extinguisher or a box of frozen pizza or the space station's backup fuel tank, as long as your shuttle can hold it.\n## Description\n>A console based adventure game.\n>\n>Very simple and has annoying controls.\n>\n>Grab what you think you might need and what others think valuable, and try to safely land on the Earth.\n","meta":{"author":[90204],"link-01-tag":"50","grade-05-out":"1","cover":"///content/c50/61/z/15890.png","grade-06-out":"1","link-01-name":"Source Code (own server)","link-02-tag":"42341","link-02-name":"Linux (own server)","link-03-tag":"42341","link-03-name":"Visible download for source code","link-04-tag":"0","link-04-name":"","link-05-tag":"42337","link-05-name":"Window (github)","link-06-tag":"0","link-06-name":"","link-01":"http://172.104.105.102/ld42.zip","link-02":"http://172.104.105.102/main.o","link-03":"http://172.104.105.102/ld42.zip"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/annoyingly-malfunctional-space-shuttle-simulator","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":0,"magic":{"grade":0,"given":0,"feedback":0,"smart":0,"cool":0}},"109070":{"id":109070,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":56521,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-13T07:24:50Z","created":"2018-08-11T02:17:14Z","modified":"2018-08-13T22:10:51Z","version":332970,"slug":"echo","name":"Echo","body":"---\n## Description\n---\nYou wake up and find yourself trapped in a room inside a ruined structure.  The ceiling is closing, and you have no way to climb out.  You're a slime after all, how can you climb.  Once the ceiling has closed in, it will fall, squishing you like it has done to so may before.  You're only hope is to find some way to stop the ceiling from completely closing in on you.  Are you only going to be prolonging your eventual death?\n\n\nThe theme for Ludum Dare 42 was to \"Running out of space\".  In this game, the ceiling is sealing itself off. You have to scramble to find active nodes to delay the inevitable.  Eventually, the ceiling will close off and fall on you.  While managing this, you also have to fight off a horde of dead slimes who have died before you.  They close in fast and overwhelm quickly if not dealt with. \n\n---\n## How to play\n---  \n\n### THERE IS A TUTORIAL IN GAME, IT IS RECOMMENDED COMPLETING IT\n\n\n**Controls**  \nKeyboard and Mouse. No Gamepad.\n \nEsc will pause the game  \n\n**Movement**\n\n​You can move using the Up, Down, Left, or Right arrow keys, or WSAD on your keyboard.  \nHolding Shift will allow you to move faster \n\n![echold3.png](///raw/9cc/d/z/173da.png)\n\n​**Attack**\n\nPressing Left Click on mouse will allow you to swing your sword to attack. You attack in the direction you are facing. \n\n![echold1.png](///raw/9cc/d/z/173d6.png)  \n\n**How to win**\n\nAs the ceiling closes in, nodes will become active.  Standing on an active node will push the walls back, but only if you have energy to do so. Energy is gained by killing enemies.\n\n![echold2.png](///raw/9cc/d/z/173d9.png)\n\nCan you survive?  Is it possible? Will you eventually die? Find out.\n\n---\n## Tools Used  \n---\n**Sound Effects**  \n\"Squish\" sound effect was recorded with Audacity, and the vocal provided by my friend ehrgeiziges\n\n**Graphics**  \nGraphics were done using Aseprite https://www.aseprite.org\n\n**Level Maps**\nLevel maps were created using OGMO Editor http://www.ogmoeditor.com/\n\n**Frameworks**  \nThe primary framework used is the MonoGame framework. http://www.monogame.net/\n\nAlong with that, I have a custom framework called Psiren which is a combination of my own code and Monocle  \nPsiren: https://gitlab.com/manbeardgames/Psiren  \nMonocle: https://bitbucket.org/MattThorson/monocle-engine\n\nAnd lastly, I used MonoGame Extended for Bitmap importing. https://craftworkgames.github.io/MonoGame.Extended/\n\n\n---\n## Notes\n---\nI'm submitting to jam, but this was a solo endeavor.  The only assets I was unable to create my own was the music, as usual.  There is music in the game, I just didn't make it. Credits to music are below.  As such, I am removing the **Audio** category for voting.  \n\n---\n## Music Credits\n---\n\n**Title Music**  \n\"Man Down\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)  \nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License  \nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/  \n\n**Game Music**  \n\"Grim Idol\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)  \nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License  \nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/  \n\n\n---\n# Change Log\n---\n\n**This fix was made at 5:50 PM EDT: 10 minutes before time closed for page submission.   There was a small audio bug in the game where the background music would not loop, it would play once and stop.  It was a simple \"IsLooping = true\" adjustment. No other changes were made to the game except this.  As such, I have provided two downloads for the game. The one I uploaded at ~4am Monday morning that has the audio non-looping, and the one I'm uploading now at 5:50 PM Monday, 10 minutes before submissions close.**\n\nEven though I have opted out of the audio category for Ludum, I wanted to be completely transparent about this.  Again, there is no difference between the original build and the audio fix build except the one line of code telling the audio to repeat.

However, these little weirdos aren't without their dangers.

They'll then dive into the dirt and start pulling out what they find. You have to run around collecting the coins. Simple!\nThe weird little buggers have a strange quirk though, if another one gets too close to them while they're digging, they start getting angry. They'll begin to heat up and smoke and flash red. If this goes on too long, they explode!\nYou need to find any angry dudes and separate them from the pack before they set off a chain reaction and destroy your farm.\n\n# Friday:\n\nBuilt the first Dude.

You always need Space bar to destroy blocks, so don't waste them otherwise you will be running out of **Space** (bar).\n- On the right side you can see the words and spaces that are coming next. Also, it tells story.\n- The words, speed, difficulty will change when you play through it.\n\n## Rule\n- Push the key that correspond to a golden block.\n- If that block is a letter, then it will turn into brown. All non-brown neighbor (left,right,up,down) will turn to golden.\n- If that block is a space bar (a 1x6 bar without text), all brown block and that space bar will be destroyed.\n- If you can't reach any space bar, we will reset the brown blocks.\n- There is a progress bar on top, when it run out of time new block will appear.\n- When the block stuck in the top row, game will over.\n\n## Control\n- Keyboard only\n- Use Enter to join game and restart.\n- Use key 'A' - 'Z', space bar to play.\n- Use Esc to force Game Over.\n\n## Development\n- Engine: http://www.amulet.xyz\n- Sound: SFXR in http://www.amulet.xyz/editor.html\n- Picture: draw by hand using Microsoft Paint\n\n\n\n","meta":{"author":[97570],"cover":"///content/22d/71/z/15b64.png","link-01":"https://gaoyuan.itch.io/running-out-of-space","link-01-tag":"42336","link-02":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tO7x2mHvnUp1dA39ibR02Ek8rqz7WQzu","link-02-tag":"42337","link-03":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KikwRKdec7K_CIzbwbFmfuOyat79IkSw","link-03-tag":"42339","link-04":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=18LnWu4aPecBtARKQhUxJZ6Rp8P3A5OkJ","link-04-tag":"42341","link-05":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lBzFxHC8x_PCMvRV4wNirxlqXwLmyAhb","link-05-tag":"42332"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/running-out-of-space-4","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":29,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T13:57:54Z","grade":{"grade-01":38,"grade-02":38,"grade-03":38,"grade-04":38,"grade-05":37,"grade-06":36,"grade-07":31,"grade-08":34},"magic":{"cool":109.64158242083,"feedback":12,"given":42.375,"grade":36.25,"smart":15.519814690844}},"109238":{"id":109238,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":64266,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-11T05:18:03Z","created":"2018-08-11T04:20:18Z","modified":"2018-08-11T05:18:03Z","version":307013,"slug":"tight-space","name":"Tight Space","body":"More blocks you make, less space you have! \n\nTry to hold on as much as possible in this minimalistic game.

Also there is a chance to find coins, which in turn give you more points. The objective is just to score as high as possible.

Only you understood what it means - that if the Moon gets too close, then the Earth's days are numbered...\n\nOnce you realised what to do, you quickly founded a start-up to build satellites and rockets, with the secret goal of building the ultimate space ship - The Ark. The Ark will be the ship to sail civilisation to another world (and most importantly, save you). The plan is simple - you will put satellites into orbit, and use the income they generate to fund research and development for The Ark. But be warned - things might not go quite to plan. Your satellites could collide and create fields of debris. The moon's gravity could modify your trajectories, and send your satellites spinning away. Antagonistic space agencies could shoot you down, and really ruin your day. You might quickly find yourself running out of space...\n\n# Instructions\n\nThe objective of the game is to build The Ark and to sail it all the way to outer space. Good luck! :rocket:\n\n## The Shop\n\nYou can buy things (including satellites) with the shop. If you have enough bitcoin to spend, click a satellite and it will start building. Once the build is complete, it will launch from Earth.\n\nHover the mouse over the items in the shop to find out more about it - like how long it takes to build, and the starting income. Special shop items have usage instructions in their hover-text.\n\nIf you don't have any bitcoin, you can always hold a press conference to try and raise some money.\n\n## Orbital Play\n\nWhen a satellite launches, it will appear on a rocket and slowly head into orbit. You can select a satellite by creating a selection box around it with the mouse. Once selected, you can control the satellite by pushing 'W' to speed up and 'S' to slow down. The orbital trajectory is shown as a blue line, and the satellite target region is shown as a green ring. The satellite statistics are shown in the info box in the bottom-right of the screen (including fuel/delta-V remaining).\n\nRemember, satellites will only make money while they are in their target area, and you have to move them there yourself! Your satellites income will decrease over time as they wear out, but you can boost your income by creating constellations of the same satellite type.\n\nYou'll receive notifications in the top-right of the screen when something interesting happens, like your satellite getting smashed to bits. Keep an eye on these. You can also view statistics about the whole game by opening the \"Orbital Statistics\" screen. You can find that button in the bottom-left of the screen.\n\n## Endgame\n\nIf you manage to make enough money before the moon gets too close and starts wreaking havoc, then you can launch The Ark! To win, simply sail it out to the target region.","meta":{"author":[81055,81152,107809,106042,91258],"link-01-tag":"42336","link-01":"https://thelonelymoon.github.io","link-02-tag":"42336","cover":"///content/f9c/31/z/17fdf.png"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/the-lonely-moon","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":0,"magic":{"cool":0,"feedback":0,"given":0,"grade":0,"smart":0}},"109528":{"id":109528,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":12271,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-12T21:20:46Z","created":"2018-08-11T08:09:56Z","modified":"2018-08-12T21:23:56Z","version":317396,"slug":"cube-disposer","name":"Cube Disposer","body":"![ezgif-3-9846d3632f.gif](///raw/fef/2/z/166a4.gif)\n\nCube Disposer is an isometric shooter where you are shooting incoming cubes.\n\n## How to play\nKill the cubes that comes.\nThe cubes will leave black blocks after they die and they will block your shots and your path but they will not block the cubes.\n\nPick up the black blocks and destroy them by dropping them in the shredder in the middle.\n\nIf you don't destroy the black blocks you will soon **run out of space**\n\n## Controls\n**Mouse** -

Go now, and good luck!\"  \n\nUse the arrow keys to move. Space to attack. Attacking kills small enemies, reflects projectiles and pushes around bigger enemies.  \nBe careful! Each step you take creates a hole behind you - if you fall, you lose! Enemies will also die if they are pushed into a hole.\n\n# About the development\n\nThis is my entry for the Ludum Dare 42 Compo, following the theme \"Running out of space\".\n\nEven before voting began, I wanted make a game with a Game Boy-like graphical style (4 tones of gray, a resolution of 160x144, the works). I feel the limitations of such a style would make for an interesting challenge, and would give me some direction when drawing the graphics.  \nOne interesting feature I wanted to implement, that would go hand-in-hand with the graphical style, was to allow the player to change the palette used by the game - so one could choose tones of gray or the greenish tones of the Game Boy screen, for example. Unfortunately, technical difficulties meant I had to drop that last idea (read: I didn't have quite enough time to implement it).\n\nOnce the theme was reveled, the idea of exploring a dungeon where each step you make would create a hole quickly came to mind, and seemed like a good fit for the graphic style. I took inspiration from \"The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening\" (and other 2D Zelda titles) when designing the crumbling dungeon, giving each gameplay feature (the holes, the attack, the teleporters, etc...) some interesting scenarios to play with. The crumbling floor, however, made balancing very difficult - any required backtracking would represent an incredible spike in difficulty.  \nDesigning a Zelda dungeon in two days (when it probably takes weeks or months for a team of professionals to do the same) was very intimidating, but given the restraints, I am happy with how it came out.\n\nThis time, I also composed the music for the game (rather than tweaking an AI to do it for me) and, while the tunes are short, I am happy with how they came to be. If possible, do give a moment to listen to Agharamish's Battle theme - depending now how long it takes you to beat him, you might not hear the actual melody.\n\nFinally, I'm happy I was able to give the game a proper introduction, title screen, main menu, ending, and even some scripted events! These little details really do make the game feel much more polished.\n\nStill, some things were left out: the game has no sound effects, no ending music, the player gets no upgrades, there's no pause function (oops! This was half implemented, but I forgot about finishing it), the dungeon only has one floor. I though of doing an introductory sequence where the player would approach the castle, but that too was cut.\n\nOverall, I'm glad with the final result. I hope you enjoy it too!\n\nGame Engine: GameMaker Studio 2  \nGraphics: Paint.net, Paint  \nMusic: Bosca Ceoil\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![main_menu.PNG](///raw/3c9/a/z/168d7.png)\n\n![entrance.PNG](///raw/3c9/a/z/168d8.png)\n\n![fight.PNG](///raw/3c9/a/z/168dc.png)\n\n## Help\n\nSo, this game is pretty hard, and you might get lost easily.

As you get better at jumping the game gets easier. Make mental notes of where bags are if they are out of your reach, so you can run back for them.\n\nMOVE: Left/Right Arrows\nJUMP: Space/Up Arrow \n\nThe game consists of 32 rooms that are randomly generated and populated similarly to the 2600 Pitfall game. The rooms have a random number from 1-32 associated with them and I check the bits of the byte of the room value to determine what and where to spawn things. The level is a circle with the end rooms wrapping around.","meta":{"author":[26425],"allow-anonymous-comments":"1","grade-08-out":"1","cover":"///content/937/6/z/17066.png","link-01":"https://georgebroussard.itch.io/bag-man","link-01-tag":"42337","link-02":"https://georgebroussard.itch.io/bag-man","link-02-tag":"42339","link-03":"https://georgebroussard.itch.io/bag-man","link-03-tag":"42336","link-04":"https://georgebroussard.itch.io/bag-man","link-04-tag":"42332"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/bag-man","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":11,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T16:51:47Z","grade":{"grade-01":14,"grade-02":14,"grade-03":14,"grade-04":14,"grade-05":14,"grade-06":14,"grade-07":14},"magic":{"grade":14,"given":0,"feedback":0,"smart":-73.273875808758,"cool":0}},"109671":{"id":109671,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":14795,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-12T19:38:17Z","created":"2018-08-11T09:46:12Z","modified":"2018-08-12T19:38:17Z","version":315771,"slug":"nose-picker","name":"Nose Picker","body":"Your nose is itching!

A giant, nightmarish black hole is slowly growing, consuming everything in its path. \nAnd on this path is our own solar system.\n \nYou are an highly advanced A.I operating the Ark, the first faster-than-light colony ship, fitted with hundred of millions of cryogenic pods to carry humans through the depths of space. Yet, it is not enough to carry the entirety of Earth's population, and building the Ark has mostly depleted the planet of its resources. You must colonize other star systems and exploit them in order to upgrade the Ark and further improve its capacity, while fleeing from the ever growing black hole. \n\nOf course, you're not supposed to save everyone... some sacrifices are necessary. Because you're running out of time. And out of space.\n\n\n_________________________________________________\n\n\n\n- Probe and colonize nearby systems to gather the minerals you will need to upgrade the Ark. The bigger the population, the quicker it will mine.\n \n- Population will grow over time, depending on the system's habitability. If habitability is under 40%, it will instead decline.\n\n- After some time, the black hole will arrive. When it approaches a system, it will slowly decrease its habitability until it reaches 0, so evacuate it quickly !\n\n- Keep fleeing upward. You may or may not find a way to escape.\n\n\n_________________________________________________\n\n\nControls :\n\n- Use the MOUSE to interact.\n- WASD or ARROW KEYS to move the camera.\n- Don't forget to press SPACE or E anytime to pause the game. It will give you more time to plan ahead and navigate through the messy UI.\n- You can press F to toggle fullscreen, but I heavily advise you AGAINST it. I didn't have enough time to properly scale the UI, it will mess it even more. The text won't be correctly centered either.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nChangelog :\n\n13/08 : Added a Linux and Mac OSX release (didn't test, tell me if it doesn't work). \nMade some bugfixing : sound not properly playing, menu not showing when clicking on another system, black hole danger radius not growing with the hole itself. Fixed pop growth rate. ~~Changed pause key from SPACE to E because of some weird engine bug with the SPACE key (don't press it or you might mess with the menus !~~\n\n13/08 : Added back SPACE as a pause key, but you still can use E if you prefer. Fixed a bug where the menus wouldn't close properly.\n\nKnown bugs/problems :\n\n- The interface. I didn't have enough time to make it more readable before compo's end, but I'm still working on it.\n- You may not be able to interact with some systems. For lack of better solution, moving the camera around usually seems to fix it.\n\nIf you see any bug, don't hesitate to report it in the comments !\n\n![mother_ship.png](///raw/78c/a1/z/16f93.png)\n\nTools used :\n\n-Engine : Godot\n\n-Graphics : Aseprite\n\n-Sound : sfxr","meta":{"author":[109703],"grade-06-out":"1","allow-anonymous-comments":"1","link-01":"https://whismirk.itch.io/mother-ship","link-01-tag":"42440","link-02":"https://whismirk.itch.io/mother-ship-source","link-02-tag":"42332","grade-07-out":"1","cover":"///content/78c/a1/z/170d2.png","link-01-name":"Windows, Linux and OSX"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/mother-ship","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":14,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T22:34:13Z","grade":{"grade-01":12,"grade-02":12,"grade-03":12,"grade-04":12,"grade-05":12,"grade-08":12},"magic":{"cool":138.63170633012,"feedback":6,"given":15.375,"grade":12,"smart":23.743686707646}},"109715":{"id":109715,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":5916,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-12T17:15:29Z","created":"2018-08-11T10:18:41Z","modified":"2018-08-12T17:15:29Z","version":314509,"slug":"life-itself","name":"Life itself","body":"Life grows fast.

I created the whole game and all the source code, shaders, graphics and sound effects from scratch in 48 hours. Please don't judge the sound effects too harshly, they were made in a rush in the last hour of the game jam. There is no music, sorry I ran out of time before I could make any. The Big Crunch was made using Unity 2018.2.3f1, visual studio community, gimp & sfxr.\n\nThe concept of The Big Crunch is quite simple. Collide matching planets and stars to compress them together as the universe shrinks. Its basically match 2! With the gameplay itself being quite simple my priority was to make a more well rounded and polished looking game. I have a title screen, in game UI and even a small tutorial. A lot of my time went into making the planets and collisions look as good as possible, not so easy for someone like me who isn't very artistic. \n\nDuring development I wasn't sure about the shrinking mechanic, I had 2 different ideas: The planets and star shrink towards the centre and you lose when 2 collide OR the planets and stars stay in the same place and you lose when the edge of the shrinking universe hits them. In the end I implemented them both as Mode A and Mode B which can be selected from the title screen.\n\n\nIn a rapidly collapsing universe smash and compress planets and stars together before running out of space.\n\n![GameStart.PNG](///raw/6ab/a1/z/16880.png)\n\n![GameZoomed.PNG](///raw/6ab/a1/z/1687a.png)\n\n![Tutorial.PNG](///raw/6ab/a1/z/16884.png)\n\n![GameOver.PNG](///raw/6ab/a1/z/1688a.png)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/GDWV7klHeCw","meta":{"author":[109478],"grade-07-out":"1","cover":"///content/6ab/a1/z/16861.png","link-01":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/h22n0r6znowdtqd/TheBigCrunchGame.zip?dl=0","link-01-tag":"42337","link-01-name":"Game","link-02":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/tyd8w7nf1d4ff7r/TheBigCrunchSource.zip?dl=0","link-02-tag":"42332","link-02-name":"Source"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/the-big-crunch","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":6,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T21:26:59Z","grade":{"grade-01":9,"grade-02":8,"grade-03":8,"grade-04":8,"grade-05":8,"grade-06":8,"grade-08":8},"magic":{"cool":143.5696517303,"feedback":2,"given":12.625,"grade":8.1428571428571,"smart":15.901244995683}},"109845":{"id":109845,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":25429,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-12T21:16:40Z","created":"2018-08-11T12:05:11Z","modified":"2018-08-12T21:17:22Z","version":317273,"slug":"enochs-salt","name":"ENOCH'S SALT","body":"![screenshot2.png](///raw/553/6/z/166b4.png)\n\nWASD + Enter to select.

Its really smooth on Firefox but suddenly drops frames, and not-so-smooth on Chrome but doesn't drop frames.\n\n\n\nSince the theme was \"Running out of space\", I decided to make a space shooter focused on saving space. How original, huh?\n\nYour goal is to protect the planets (the big coloured spheres) from the enemies you can see flying around everywhere. Those will automatically target the planets and ignore you, but *will* hurt you if you touch them.\n\nIt plays like a twin stick shooter, you move with WASD and shoot with the arrow keys. Your keyboard layout will not influence this (azerty, etc, it doesn't matter.)\n\nYou will gain powerups upon reaching a certain amount of score (top-left corner, alongside with your health, in pink). Those powerups change your projectiles, enhance their damage, reach, etc. But they also make it easier to friendly-fire your allies, the planets. Be careful...\n\nOf course, upon firing on a planet, you will see your points removed (by a fixed amount depending on the planet size). And your weapon downgrade. Where would be the fun otherwise? :P\n\nThe game is won when you kill all the monsters, and is lost when you die, or when all the planets are destroyed.\n\nPlease excuse the bugs, the roughness, etc. Its only my second gamejam and I kind of jumped into it 6hrs late because \"fuck it, why not after all\". I also used a technology I'm not familiar with (the canvas) and struggle a lot mostly with this, losing a lot of time on stupid stuff.\n\nWritten in vanilla JS. Uses the canvas, the Web Audio API and thats pretty much it. I tested mostly in Google Chrome so it should fine on anything Webkit or Blink related.\n\nTools used:\n\n- WebStorm\n\n- Paint.NET\n\n- Bfxr\n\nBig thanks to @ericoporto from https://github.com/ericoporto/png-font !

When making games, my goal tends to create something that works on both a PC and my Android phone. So, feel free to check out my game via **WebGL** or **Android**, the choice is yours!\n\nI decided to try something new with **Space Equations**... making a (rather simple) educational game. The goal is simple, don't let the game board fill up with nasty Red Boxes. The more equations you solve, the longer you live. You (or more likely your young child) might just learn something in the process.\n\n---\n\n## How To Play\n- Touch a Red Box\n- A Math Equation Will Appear\n- Touch Two Numbers to Solve the Equation\n- Watch the Red Box Explode\n\n---\n\n## Developer Notes:\n\nDue to a crazy, hectic weekend schedule, I almost wasn't able to pull the trigger on joining this Compo. I got to clock in roughly 20 hours on this labor of love. As a result, the game's scope is rather small, which lead to some shortcomings. As always, the usual programmer graphics and sounds/music are in full effect. While I'm happy enough with the music, I wish I had more time to create and integrate better effects. I would have also liked to polish the presentation much more. \n\nThat said, I kept my requirements creep urges at bay and fought to stay focused on getting out a working game.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with what I've accomplished and I'm looking forward to hear what everyone thinks about it! **Thanks for playing :-)** \n\n---\n\n## Tools:\n\n* Unity 2018.2\n* Inkscape\n* Audacity\n* 1998 Fender Toronado\n\n---\n\n## Screen Shots:\n![2018-08-12_17-23-38.png](///raw/03a/d/z/16709.png)\nClicking on numbers to solve Equations","meta":{"author":[55856],"link-01-tag":"50","allow-anonymous-comments":"1","link-01":"https://fussenkuh.itch.io/space-equations","link-01-name":"Source Code","link-02":"https://fussenkuh.itch.io/space-equations","link-02-tag":"42336","cover":"///content/03a/d/z/167a7.png","link-03":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.FussenKuh.SpaceEquations","link-03-tag":"42342"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/space-equations","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":12,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T13:42:02Z","grade":{"grade-01":9,"grade-02":10,"grade-03":10,"grade-04":10,"grade-05":9,"grade-06":9,"grade-07":8,"grade-08":7},"magic":{"grade":9,"given":10.625,"feedback":7,"smart":21.93613513898,"cool":115.24430571616}},"110809":{"id":110809,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":73068,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-12T17:25:12Z","created":"2018-08-11T22:54:27Z","modified":"2018-08-12T17:25:12Z","version":314574,"slug":"running-out-of-space-7","name":"running out of space","body":"first ludum dare! very happy that I was able to do this at age 12! you can view in here https://ezra-h.itch.io/running-out-of-space","meta":{"author":[73068],"link-01":"https://ezra-h.itch.io/running-out-of-space","link-01-tag":"42337","cover":"///content/c6d/11/z/160f8.png","allow-anonymous-comments":"1"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/running-out-of-space-7","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":1,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-12T17:46:05Z","magic":{"cool":0,"feedback":0,"given":0,"grade":0,"smart":0}},"110812":{"id":110812,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":110810,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-13T19:49:50Z","created":"2018-08-11T22:56:03Z","modified":"2018-08-13T19:51:00Z","version":329698,"slug":"nimble-in-the-dark","name":"Nimble in the Dark","body":"![2018-08-13_21-18-02.png](///raw/ad0/b1/z/17e82.png)\n\nYou are running out of light!

And what he remembers is crucial to advance in the game.\n\n## Objective\n1. Kill zombie priests to obtain potions. You'll need them.  \n(Don't worry about using them, as the game makes Billy drink one if he's low on health and it has just been hit).  \n2. Go inside cabins to obtain clues to where your murderer is located.  \n3. You only have 3 slots of memory, you have to decide if the information presented to you is worth remembering or not.  \n4. Once you have enough clues you can go into the direction you think your murderer is, and if you really have all the clues, then the guard will simply let you pass.  \n\n## Constraints\nYou need all 3 memories to quit the city.  \n\n## Notes\n- Dying doesn't erase your memory.  \n- If you loose at the final boss you can keep trying. The guards die once you see the final boss face.  \n\n## So Theme\nYou run out of space in your brain... 'cause you're dead... so there's that.\n\n## Personal comments\n- Due to pico 8's token limit I had to cut out a pseudo 3D cabin section.  \n![ld42_9.gif](///raw/e40/3/z/16d4a.gif)  \n- I had planned 5 cities, but could only make one D:  \n\nHope you enjoy the game!\n\n","meta":{"author":[12366],"link-01":"https://github.com/Rombusevil/ld42-password-camp","link-01-tag":"50","link-02":"https://rombus.itch.io/password-camp","link-02-tag":"42336","cover":"///content/e40/3/z/16c77.png","link-03-tag":"42332","link-03":"https://github.com/Rombusevil/ld42-password-camp"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/password-camp","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":1,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-12T23:26:59Z","grade":{"grade-01":1,"grade-02":1,"grade-03":1,"grade-04":1,"grade-05":1,"grade-06":1,"grade-07":1,"grade-08":1},"magic":{"cool":0,"feedback":0,"given":0,"grade":1,"smart":0}},"110917":{"id":110917,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":52863,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-12T19:53:04Z","created":"2018-08-12T00:38:13Z","modified":"2018-08-12T19:53:04Z","version":315967,"slug":"jelly-belly-his-friend-octo","name":"Jelly Belly & his friend Octo","body":"![fun3.gif](///raw/f7e/c/z/15b7b.gif)\n\nA cooperative multiplayer game.

Ancient technology containing potentially harmful viruses and other dangers are also present.    \nTerminals can be found in the cave that reveal useful information.  \n\nControls:  \nLeft/Right arrow keys  - move  \nUp / Space             - jump  \nhold Down arrow        - dance(unintended bug that is now a feature)  \nZ and X                - interact  \n\nHeavily inspired by Broken Cave Robot.\n\n\nCHANGELOG:  \n\nv1.0.0:  \n* Initial release  \n\nv1.1.0:  \n* First web build  \n* Light shape around player is no longer dependent on aspect ratio (always a circle now)  \n* Fixed terminal text being closed automatically and immediately when interacted with  \n* Fixed main menu background not covering the whole screen  \n\nv1.1.1:\n* Added version number to main menu  \n* Added icon to .exe file   \n\nv1.2.0:  \n* Fixed dying multiple times after the initial death being possible  \n","meta":{"author":[41947],"allow-anonymous-comments":"1","link-01":"https://github.com/SiiMeR/LD42Compo","link-01-tag":"42332","link-02":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kd5AUo7FykwZKShw46ux7W_hIGHXhUvp/view?usp=sharing","link-02-tag":"42337","cover":"///content/bd3/a/z/16f1a.png","link-02-name":"v1.0.0","link-03":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/15B1OsXydvIwH9X0nu9XE8AdOPmjrvuEl/view?usp=sharing","link-03-tag":"42337","link-03-name":"v1.1.0","link-04":"https://siimer.github.io/LD42Compo/","link-04-tag":"42440","link-04-name":"from v1.1.0 onwards (always the latest version)","link-05":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cidAv1wFiqyHoBOut4zYQqToLLUh34D3/view?usp=sharing","link-05-tag":"42337","link-05-name":"v1.1.1","link-06":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KgCfiR_A5G19r2HLKbY5ms2kYNs1DiAM/view?usp=sharing","link-06-tag":"42337","link-06-name":"v1.2.0"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/the-last-robot","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":1,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T11:18:33Z","grade":{"grade-01":1,"grade-02":1,"grade-03":1,"grade-04":1,"grade-05":1,"grade-06":1,"grade-07":1,"grade-08":1},"magic":{"grade":1,"given":0.75,"feedback":0,"smart":0,"cool":86.602540378444}},"111307":{"id":111307,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":6370,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-12T09:38:38Z","created":"2018-08-12T09:28:22Z","modified":"2018-08-12T09:42:00Z","version":312496,"slug":"shelf-space","name":"Shelf Space","body":"​![ShelfSpaceWithBooks.PNG](///raw/2e8/1/z/15d22.png)\nShelf Space is my Ludum Dare 42 compo entry.

It was cancelled due to the Stencyl 2D physics engine being really bad at handling too many objects at one go, and was lagging my computer heavily (and possibly other players). \n\n![frantic.png](///raw/bed/e/z/177b6.png)\n","meta":{"author":[60907],"link-01-tag":"42337","grade-06-out":"1","allow-anonymous-comments":"1","cover":"///content/bed/e/z/177c2.png","link-01":"https://hor1zon.itch.io/frantic-arrows","link-02-tag":"42336"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/frantic-arrows","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":0,"magic":{"cool":0,"feedback":0,"given":0,"grade":0,"smart":0}},"111415":{"id":111415,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":189,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-13T16:47:08Z","created":"2018-08-12T11:33:18Z","modified":"2018-08-13T16:47:08Z","version":327362,"slug":"sticks-and-stones","name":"Sticks and Stones","body":"**Content warning: abusive language, suicide**\n\nJoin the adorable little bubble gum person on a walk through the fragile psyche.

One day, nature had enough and decided to get rid of this pest called humanity. More and more nature disasters take place and decimate the human population. As many cities are not habitable anymore the people are running out of living space.\n\nYou probably thought you will be helping the humans, but you are wrong! You play as nature and your goal is to get rid of every last human being. To do this you have a large tool set of nature disasters at your disposal. Will you send a meteor, a tsunami or even a bear?\n\n![promo003.png](///raw/11a/z/16119.png)\n\n## How to play\nIn each turn you draw a card from the pile. You then have to perform the action displayed on the card. Most of the cards are disaster cards. With these you can choose a city, or for some also a road, where the disaster will take place. There is also a city and a road card. The first will establish a new city and grant humanity some more space to hide from you. Although you can not prevent the creation of the city you can choose where it is built. After drawing the road card you have to build a new road between two cities. To do this, click on the first city and then on the second city. After the action was performed you may draw a new card.\n\nIf you don't want to play a card right away you may save at most one. To do this you can click on the card to the left. You can not do this if there is already a card there. To use it later you click the card *before* you draw a card from the pile.\n\n![promo001.png](///raw/11a/z/16122.png)\n\nEach city has an associated attractiveness which is influenced by many factors including population, number of connected roads, age and occurred disasters. People will move from cities with low attractiveness to directly connected cities with high attractiveness. The rate at which they move depends on the difference in attractiveness. The attractiveness is displayed with the hearts above the city. The number below the hearts is the population of the city.\n\nA nature disaster will lower a cities attractiveness and thereby might drive people to neighboring cities. It will also kill part of the population. Some disasters kill a certain percentage of the population while others kill a fixed number, or a combination of both. A few disasters can be applied to roads and will destroy the road. The following table shows the effects of the different disasters.\n\n| Disaster     | Absolute | Relative | Attractiveness | Road? |\n| ------------ | -------- | -------- | -------------- | ----- |\n| Heat Wave    | 5%       | 20 - 30  | 0.1            | No    |\n| Thunderstorm | 5%       | -        | 0.2            | No    |\n| Earthquake   | 10%      | -        | 0.8            | Yes   |\n| Forest Fire  | 40%      | -        | 0.8            | No    |\n| Bear Attack  | 50%      | 50 - 200 | 1.2            | No    |\n| Plague       | 70%      | -        | 1.7            | No    |\n| Meteor       | -        | 50 - 100 | 2.0            | Yes   |\n| Tsunami      | -        | 20 - 30  | 2.0            | Yes   |\n\nIf the same disaster happens several times in the same city it will boost the effects of the disaster. For this only the last three disasters are taken into account. They are displayed under each city.\n\nYou win as soon as the global population reaches zero.\n\n![promo004.png](///raw/11a/z/1611e.png)\n\n## Controls\nYou can play the game without a keyboard. For some actions there are keyboard shortcuts:\n\n - Move map: W/A/S/D or Arrow Keys\n - Next card: Space or Enter\n - Save card: Q\n\nIf you wish to turn off the music you can click the button in the top right corner.\n\n## Credits\nDesign, Code, Audio by Matteo Signer and Benjamin Schmid.

This is my first time entering a Ludum Dare, so I don't know if I did everything right. It's even my first time finishing a game haha. It's supposed to be a mobile game, but I thought it'd be easier if I put it in an .exe format. It did get zoomed in because of that, and I needed to add black bars too.\n\nThe story is that you are part of a cleaning software, and you must delete all bytes you see, because that's what cleaning software does when you're running out of space.\n\nHere are some screenshots of the game:\n\nTitle screen:\n![MenuScreenshot.jpg](///raw/2f4/b1/z/162f5.jpg)\n\nGameplay screenshots:\n![GameplayScreenshot1.jpg](///raw/2f4/b1/z/162f8.jpg)\n![GameplayScreenshot2.jpg](///raw/2f4/b1/z/162fa.jpg)\n![GameplayScreenshot3.jpg](///raw/2f4/b1/z/162fb.jpg)\n\nGame over screen:\n![GameplayScreenshot4.jpg](///raw/2f4/b1/z/162fc.jpg)\n\nGameplay:\nhttps://youtu.be/1sJD6VYrmKc\nThe video does have more lag than normal, because I don't have a good laptop, so I highly recommend downloading the game for a better experience.\n\nHope you enjoy!!\n\nP.S. I wasn't sure how to export it properly, so the first link is only the .exe file, and the second link is all the rest that came with the export. If the first link doesn't work, try downloading from the second link, but don't delete the first .exe file, since that's the only .exe file there.

DH:ROTWK is a 2-player competitive arcade game where a thicc Dragon and a gloopy Wizard King face off in a battle of ultimate strategy. \n\nContrary to popular belief, “Revenge of the Wizard King” is not a sequel, but a reboot of the Dragon Horde franchise. Open-World Battle-Royale elements have been scrapped in order to accommodate the superior high-intensity spirit of Jezzball.\n\nNo one quite knows why the Magical Monarch wants revenge against the Dragon. Some say the Dragon re-did the interior design of the King’s castle without his knowledge, thus replacing the floor with crumbling hexagonal pillars and the walls with bottomless pits.

In this arena of aeration, these pilots' seeds will surely be tested. Sign-ups open now! You could be the next top sky-mulcher!\n\nIn Drone Gardening League, pilot your drone around the small offshore island arena. Each round of the tournament lasts just a few minutes. Periodically, your garden will be scored. The drone with the highest score at the end of the round wins. Between rounds you can re-equip your drone with other modules to help reach victory. Maybe bring new flower seeds in. If those flowers defend themselves or you accidentally spill some high-test weedkiller, well, that's just drone gardening for you.\n\n### Mechanics\n - You have a deck of cards that control various features of your drone. You can swap out cards between rounds.\n - Each card requires various resources listed on the card.\n   - Battery (white): recharge by returning to your base station\n   - Water (blue): suck up water by hovering over the water offshore\n   - Elixer (purple): acquired automatically, or extract some from purple goop deposits around the island\n - A panel of judges score your garden every 10 seconds\n   - 4 fully-grown plants are worth a star\n   - Starflower and royal starflowers are worth more\n   - The current standings are shown in the top left\n\n### Reviwer Notes\n - you are the red player\n - The first level is a bit of a tutorial, mostly to get used to the controls\n - There is no penalty for losing a round\n - you must have 15 cards in your deck to start a new round. You will have to add cards after the tutorial\n - There is no end state. There are three maps after the tutorial that are picked at random\n\n### Change Log\n - 8/13/18: card rendering fixes, fix sorting in the deckbuilder and remember which drone you picked, fix arrow keys, prevent base from being killed, fix some grid highlights, AI fixes","meta":{"author":[2727],"allow-anonymous-comments":"1","link-01-tag":"42337","link-01":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/3ziqxdt64d8xxny/Drone%20Gardening.exe?dl=0","link-02":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/1tx4xxy4zg70gnc/Drone%20Gardening%20Source.zip?dl=0","link-02-tag":"42332","cover":"///content/7aa/z/172f3.png"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/drone-gardening-league","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":0,"magic":{"cool":0,"feedback":0,"given":0,"grade":0,"smart":0}},"112165":{"id":112165,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":52500,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-12T21:09:04Z","created":"2018-08-12T20:32:23Z","modified":"2018-08-12T21:09:33Z","version":317141,"slug":"territory","name":"Territory","body":"A strategy game where you are running out of space (For your empire!)\n\nAll the instructions are included in the game.\n\nThere is no audio as I ran out of time before I could make any.

You've got a lot of people, they keep making more people, and the lot of them all want roofs over their heads. Building houses is pretty fast with the fancy crystal energy generators your people have, but there's a bit of a complication. The trouble is that you happen to live on an island in the sky, and there isn't all that much space to go around. There are more islands to expand to, but they're infested with weird blue bug things. Looks like if you want to avoid running out of space to put houses, you'll have to put the 'aggressive' in 'aggressively expansionist.'\n\n- Controls: Mouse + Hotkeys (1-4)\n\n- Left click an island to select it.\n\n- Use the buttons or hotkeys to create buildings and units at the selected island.\n\n- With an island selected, right click another island to send units from the first island to the second.\n\n- Your population will grow over time.

Sadly, it means that we are **running out of space to display the wonderful game that you want to play**.\n\nTherefore, we had to use the only space left to display the game: **the URL address bar at the top of your browser window**.\n\n[![outrunning_space_coverD.png](///raw/df3/z/1686d.png)](https://v6p9d9t4.ssl.hwcdn.net/html/998148/index.html)\n\n## How to play?\n\n**Look up at the URL bar!**\n\nYou are the *\"X\"* running out from the deadly **\"Space\"** at the left of the screen.\n\nFrom time to time, you'll see **\"o\" shaped obstacles** on the floor.\n\nPress **any key to jump** over the obstacles.\n\nYou'll earn **1 point** each time you evade an obstacle.\n\nIf you **hit an obstacle**, you'll fall back and will come closer to the space of the left.\n\n**Once the space catches you, you're dead!**\n\n*Your current score is displayed between the two \"#\" signs.* \n\n## About the game\n\nSadly, due to real life constraints, I had only **2h30** in total to work on a game for this compo.\n\nI really loved the theme, and while I knew I had to keep the scope very small due to very limited time, I thought that it could be funny to interpret the theme as \"we are running out of space in the web page to display the game, so you have to play it from the URL bar\".\n\nSo that's it, **\"Outrunning Space!\" is a very simple game taking place in the URL bar**, where you have to avoid obstacles in order to outrun a deadly \"Space\" in the URL.\n\nIt was made in Javascript, using the location.replace() method to modify the URL display inside the browser URL bar.\n\n## Extra theme constraints\n\nAt first, I thought that the theme could be a cool way to make a \"small game\", as in \"taking as less disk space as possible for the source code\". So, there you have it: once minified *(striped comments + regpack'ed)* the **whole code source is only 792 Bytes**, so way below the famous 1KB code limit of the JS1K code compo :).\n\nThe source code is **inside the HTML page of the game** (due to its small size, I wrote it directly inside the HTML page, with comments and all).\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**All in all,** I hope you enjoy this game despite its very \"simplistic\" nature (using a 1x20 display area is though!)\n\nBy-the-way, it's a Javascript game, it should work on every browser, except Safari (and maybe others) as it doesn't display the whole URL in the address bar. \n\nI've only tested it on Firefox, so I hope it will also run well on others browsers (I lacked time to do more thorough testing, sorry!)","meta":{"author":[1021],"allow-anonymous-comments":"1","grade-06-out":"1","link-01":"https://drludos.itch.io/outrunning-space","link-01-tag":"50","link-01-name":"See Javascript source code inside the HTML page","link-02":"https://v6p9d9t4.ssl.hwcdn.net/html/998148/index.html","link-02-tag":"42336","cover":"///content/df3/z/1683c.png"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/outrunning-space-1","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":13,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T14:45:39Z","grade":{"grade-01":13,"grade-02":13,"grade-03":13,"grade-04":13,"grade-05":11,"grade-07":13,"grade-08":11},"magic":{"grade":12.428571428571,"given":1.75,"feedback":2,"smart":-52.961253437608,"cool":42.096934552698}},"112290":{"id":112290,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":36888,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-12T21:53:14Z","created":"2018-08-12T21:20:31Z","modified":"2018-08-12T21:56:35Z","version":318527,"slug":"cubed-in","name":"Cubed In","body":"You are a cube, when you move the place you were gets occupied, thus making you run out of space.

The interpretation I went for was \"space\" being stars and such and not a physical/digital \"space\". So in the case of the game, you're \"running out of space\" as you fill the sky with constellations.\n\nEverything was created during the jam! I hope you enjoy it!\n\n## Credits\n\n-    **ART/PROGRAMMING/MUSIC/ETC:** http://twitter.com/paigemarincak\n-    **SPECIAL THANKS:** ​http://twitter.com/ciemarincak​ for helping me with the idea \n\n## Technical Stuff\n\n-    **ENGINE:** GameMaker Studio 2\n-    **ART:** Photoshop\n-    **MUSIC:** Garage Band\n\n## Controls\n\n-    **EVERYTHING:** Left-mouse button\n-    Click and drag on stars","meta":{"author":[24306],"grade-07-out":"1","link-01":"https://atemly-games.itch.io/constellations","link-01-tag":"42336","cover":"///content/2fe/5/z/16d0b.png","link-02":"https://atemly-games.itch.io/constellations","link-02-tag":"42337"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/constellations","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":0,"magic":{"cool":0,"feedback":0,"given":0,"grade":0,"smart":0}},"112325":{"id":112325,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":112128,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-12T22:03:23Z","created":"2018-08-12T21:29:23Z","modified":"2018-08-13T15:17:29Z","version":322738,"slug":"culminating-demise","name":"Culminating Demise","body":"Second game I've ever made and first Game Jam.

(Going out of light means imminent death after a few seconds.)\n\nThe game consists of the one *hard* boss fight. That's all.\n\nOh, and you die in one hit!\n\n# Controls\n\n * **Arrows** - movement\n * **X** - shoot\n * **Z** - dash\n * F11 - toggle fullscreen\n\nTry to **stay in the circle of light**. You can go outside for a few seconds, but stay for too long and you'll die miserably. (There is a visual indicator, so you'll know how much time you have.)\n\nDashing not only allows you to move faster, but it also makes you invulnerable, *and* destroys projectiles.\n\n(non-QUERTY keyboards are supported properly - Z and X will be remapped to whatever the two bottom-left keys on your keyboard are)\n\n# Strategy Guide\n\n**(skip to avoid spoilers)**\n\nThis game might be a bit too hard. (Like, *Titan Souls*-esque hard.)\n\nWhile it might be interesting to figure everything out by yourself, it may be too frustrating.\n\nHere are a few tips to make your life easier:\n\n * Phase 1 - Crystals  \n   This shouldn't be hard. Use dash to dodge bullets, and shoot crystals from afar.\n\n * Phase 2 - Laser  \n   Simply wait behind a rock, until the boss comes nearby. Then dash sideways, get behind his back and hit him a few times.\n\n * Phase 3 - More crystals  \n   This one is tricky. Try to destroy one of the two crystals ASAP, preferably before it starts shooting. Then you can hide behind the boss and chill.  \n   There is a trick to destroying the second one: Instead of rushing towards it, use boss shield to deflect bullets towards the crystal while sitting in a safe spot.\n   \n * Phase 4 - Magic  \n   At this point you should know how to dodge.  \n   First, you need to kill the two small orbs. Beware: when one is destroyed, the other and the boss itself will start shooting at you.\n   After both orbs die, the boss becomes vulnerable, but also aggressive. You'll need to dash a lot.\n\nThat's all, good luck!\n\n# Please comment\n\nYour feedback is important!\n\n# Help needed!\n\nSome people in comments have reported a visual game-breaking bug. None of my friends can reproduce, so I'm somewhat stuck for now.\n\n**If the bug happens to you, you can help immensely** by contacting me (on Discord: HolyBlackCat#7530, or some other method of your choice), and running a few tests to collect some data for me. Expect it to take approximately 15 minutes.\n\n## Changelog\n\n2. Fixed respawn point placement\n1. Initial upload\n\nBug reports will be appreciated as well.","meta":{"author":[467],"link-01-tag":"42337","link-01":"https://holyblackcat.itch.io/the-last-witch-knight","link-02":"https://holyblackcat.itch.io/the-last-witch-knight","link-02-tag":"42332","link-01-name":"Windows + Source","link-02-name":"Source","link-03":"https://github.com/HolyBlackCat/LD42","link-03-tag":"42332","link-03-name":"Github","cover":"///content/3d1/z/17122.png"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/the-last-witch-knight","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":11,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T12:49:37Z","grade":{"grade-01":7,"grade-02":7,"grade-03":7,"grade-04":7,"grade-05":7,"grade-06":7,"grade-07":7,"grade-08":7},"magic":{"cool":107.04360482221,"feedback":3,"given":6.875,"grade":7,"smart":9.3813773650968}},"112356":{"id":112356,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":383,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-13T15:07:02Z","created":"2018-08-12T21:39:04Z","modified":"2018-08-13T15:42:05Z","version":326684,"slug":"snake-mango","name":"Snake Mango","body":"![Screen Shot 2018-08-13 at 10.29.37 AM.png](///raw/f71/z/1786f.png)\n\nAlmost didn't MAKE IT!!! \n\nWith only 12h available to me this weekend, I had to still try to get something done for LD42.\n\nI present you Snake Mango.\n\n\nA snake clone with a twist.

Maybe someday it will have some music.\n\nAnyways here is the idea for this game with this Ludum Dares theme \"Running out of space\".\n\nYou start out with three Players. Your goal: keep them alive as long as possible. You'll get Loot from enemies and also from chests. Some of these are useable some are not. Useable items will vanish after they were used, equip items however will not. \n![How_to.png](///raw/0b3/21/z/16de9.png)\n\nThe violet highlighted boxes are where you obtain your loot. If all of these slots are occupied you won't get any new loot. -> Keep them empty!\n\nThe other coloured boxes represent the free storage of the group. Each group Member has 2 colored Columns.

Any constructive feedback or questions are appreciated, and I will try and get back to comments as soon as possible.","meta":{"author":[1524],"allow-anonymous-comments":"1","grade-06-out":"1","cover":"///content/4f5/z/16f8a.png","link-01":"https://github.com/smilewood/LD42-RisingTIde/archive/v1.zip","link-01-tag":"50","link-02":"https://github.com/smilewood/LD42-RisingTIde/releases/download/v1/LD42_RisingTide_Windows.zip","link-02-tag":"42337","link-03":"https://github.com/smilewood/LD42-RisingTIde/releases/download/v1/LD42_RisingTide_Mac.zip","link-03-tag":"42339","link-04":"https://github.com/smilewood/LD42-RisingTIde/releases/download/v1/LD42_RisingTide_Linux.zip","link-04-tag":"42341","link-05":"https://smilewood.itch.io/rising-tide","link-05-tag":"42336"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/rising-tide","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":28,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T20:43:41Z","grade":{"grade-01":35,"grade-02":33,"grade-03":35,"grade-04":35,"grade-05":34,"grade-07":32,"grade-08":32},"magic":{"grade":33.714285714286,"given":28.375,"feedback":28,"smart":5.9990351585591,"cool":99.780460767012}},"112508":{"id":112508,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":106,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"compo","published":"2018-08-12T22:31:15Z","created":"2018-08-12T22:09:39Z","modified":"2018-08-12T22:31:15Z","version":320009,"slug":"prototype-shooter","name":"Prototype Shooter","body":"This has been a rough LD for me.

We can only store the best results - inefficient runs will be terminated immediately. Don't let us down!\n\n# Instructions \n\nAs you play, the game is dynamically generating a replay for your inputs. The more complex your inputs are, the more space they will take out, and the quicker you will run out.\n\nEach level has a byte quota that your inputs should fall under to succeed. You will need to collect keys to complete some levels. Note that the byte quota is not optimal on most of the levels - you can easily find solutions that use less space. Use the leaderboards to compare your scores to others.\n\nEach button press AND release costs *2 bytes* (time since last press, buttons pressed/released).\nEach missile fire costs *6 bytes* (fire command, position (x,y) as short)\n\nHolding both directions will cause you to slide frictionlessly. This is very useful if you don't want to release a key, which would cost 2 bytes.\n\n# FAQ\n## My browser does not seem to support this game?\nThis game is written in ES6. Most modern browsers should support it, but if you haven't updated you may run into issues.\n\n## Why am I playing as a fox?\nThe main character is a fox so I can break the cycle of every player sprite being a robot in literally all of my Ludum Dare Entries. This game could have been Low Battery 4.\n\n## Where do the missiles come from?\n??????????????\n\n## Level X seems impossible\nThe limitations of the game mean you need to think about platformers a bit differently. Jumping at the right time during the player's acceleration, for instance, is useful for getting low times on many of the courses.\n\nA few courses are designed with momentum in mind, which can help you save presses and releases. Instead of moving directionally, try holding both directions to slide around. You can tell when you're doing this if you emit sparkles.\n\nAlso, try not releasing keys after pressing them. This is useful if you know you aren't going to jump again in the level - simply hold the key all the way to the finish.

Fixed a few bugs along the way, hope no one minds. All substantive work was completed by the deadline, I swear. :)\n\n![DerRaumGamePlayGIF-reduced.gif](///raw/660/b/z/17458.gif)\n\nDer Raum is strongly inspired by an arcade game from my youth, the name of which I'm not going to reveal just yet to see if anyone recognizes it. I spent many, many quarters on the game as a teenager. \n\nThe gist of it is you're trapped in an ever-shrinking room and need to get out... and you will, only to find out you're stuck in another room, over and over again, and it's only getting more and more crowded each time.\n\nI have more enemy types partially complete but not playable in the game. The game should be a progression of enemy types, each with their own behaviors. But, since I don't have them all ready, I've opted to let you play one room over and over again, with sliiightly increasing difficulty every runthrough. It does get quite challenging, and eventually, of course, you WILL fail.\n\n**CONTROLS:**\n\nAs follows, but note:\n\n**A DUAL-STICK CONTROLLER IS REQUIRED!** (keep reading)\n\n- **Left stick:** *player movement*\n- **Right stick:** *shooting*\n- **Start / A:** *start the game from the title screen*\n- **M on keyboard:** *toggles audio muting on/off*\n\n** ~~BUG~~ engine/browser issue: If you don't have music right away at the title screen, press M TWICE to toggle the audio off and back on again. Should fix it. I'll fix the code later! Sorry!**\n\nWhile the arrow keys on the keyboard still work for player movement, this game is controller-based. It's a twin-stick shooter, basically, in my incarnation... although I have limited the firing to eight directions as a hat tip in the general direction of the yet-to-be-revealed arcade original. \n\nAnd for those of you that don't have controllers, I am truly sorry. I'm OK with it being a controller-only game. It was developed and tested with a newer bluetooth-capable Xbox One controller, both via BT and via USB cable. I suspect any reasonably-modern dual-joystick controller would work (old PS2/PS3 controllers, 360 controllers, random Logitechs, etc). If any of you try other joysticks with success, I'd love it if you'd let me know. :)\n\nI created some music using Auxy on my iPad this time. I'm not a musician, and I'm not a composer. It's not exactly the music I had in my head when I was making the game, but I figure something is better than nothing. I'm also not all that wild about most of the sound effects in the game... but again, solo compo participant, limited time, and it's still better to have something than nothing. \n\nI both love and hate that audio can really make or break a game's feel. Hopefully it'll grow on you. I think I'm missing a few sounds here and there, but nothing crazy-important. And again, the M key on the keyboard is there if you hate it all or just wanna quietly play. ;)\n\nI spent a lot more time on art this time, which I'm pretty happy with, though most of it like the majority of the mechanics work, you won't get to see--yet, anyway, I hope.\n\n**TOOLS:**\n\nGame was made with Construct 2:\nhttps://www.scirra.com/construct2\n\nAudio was created using Auxy on iPad, bxfr, and ChipTone.\n \nAuxy:\nhttp://auxy.co/\n\nbfxr:\nhttps://www.bfxr.net/\n\nChipTone:\nhttp://sfbgames.com/chiptone/\n\nImages created in PyxelEdit, with some light MS Paint usage:\nhttps://pyxeledit.com/\n\nProgression tables done via Google Sheets.\n\nGoogle Home streamed \"Code Radio - 24/7 concentration music for programmers\" from freeCodeCamp.org via YouTube:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQ22pgaXog4\n\nWinSCP used to upload HTML5 code and the various game builds to my website:\nhttps://winscp.net/eng/index.php\n\nIf you find any breaking bugs or other annoyances, or even \\*gasp\\* an Easter egg or two (maybe?)... please let me know. I'd also love ANY other feedback you can offer. \n\nThose that leave a well-intended comment, I'll definitely rate you back! \n\nAnd since my son and his friend were here all weekend making their games, why not reward them with a rating?

A pretty careless gardener at that. The island itself is held toghether by a special crystal plant. However the plant dies one day, and being unprepared, you spend almost all of your money to buy a new sprout. It will take some time to regrow and island itself slowly starts to collapse.\n\n![3.png](///raw/d35/61/z/179ed.png)\n\nYour task is to grow plants and sell them for profit while island around you collapses. Less space means less plants, less plants means less profit. In order to win you need to survive until the crystal plant grows fully. You can't fall off the island and you can't allow your house or crystal plant to collapse. Plants will yeld you shards, which can be used to purchase more seeds, as well as island repair kits (You can use those to bring back 1 tile). Be careful what you plant though. Some plants will affect your islands integrity which determines how often landfalls occur.\n\n![2.png](///raw/d35/61/z/179eb.png)\n\nYou will be required to manage space for plants as well as your money, so you can buy island repair kits and repair the damage. If the tile with plant gets removed, the plant is also gone. However tiles will only collapse if they are on the border of the island (Red grass colour). You can protect your house and plants by building around them. You lose if landfall occurs while either your house or your crystal plant is on the border or your character is standing on a tile that is about collapse. I recommend playing on easy difficulity first so you can get familliar with the plants and then move to normal or maybe even hard.\n\n![1.png](///raw/d35/61/z/179e2.png)\n","meta":{"author":[91453],"grade-07-out":"1","link-01-tag":"42336","cover":"///content/d35/61/z/1799f.png","grade-08-out":"1","grade-06-out":"1","link-01":"https://jakupf.itch.io/blooming-heights"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/blooming-heights","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":0,"magic":{"cool":0,"feedback":0,"given":0,"grade":0,"smart":0}},"113071":{"id":113071,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":4956,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-13T17:08:08Z","created":"2018-08-13T05:14:52Z","modified":"2018-08-13T17:50:53Z","version":328012,"slug":"taco-time","name":"Taco Time","body":"![Untitled-5.png](///raw/c53/1/z/17ae3.png)\n\nGrab the food items to complete the order.\nGrabbing the wrong ingredients cancels the order.\nDon't grab non food items, or your restaurant will shut down!\n\nmove - wasd\n\njump - space!\n\n\n![Aug-13-2018 10-46-14.gif](///raw/c53/1/z/17af7.gif)\n\n![Aug-13-2018 10-46-55.gif](///raw/c53/1/z/17afa.gif)\n\n![Aug-13-2018 10-47-27.gif](///raw/c53/1/z/17afe.gif)\n\n![Aug-13-2018 10-45-41.gif](///raw/c53/1/z/17b00.gif)","meta":{"author":[4956,89438],"allow-anonymous-comments":"1","link-01-tag":"42336","cover":"///content/c53/1/z/17327.png","link-01":"https://wholesalebirbs.itch.io/taco-time"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/taco-time","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":0,"grade":{"grade-01":1,"grade-02":1,"grade-03":1,"grade-04":1,"grade-05":1,"grade-06":1,"grade-07":1,"grade-08":1},"magic":{"cool":0,"feedback":0,"given":0,"grade":1,"smart":0}},"113079":{"id":113079,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":83230,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-13T06:33:02Z","created":"2018-08-13T05:25:33Z","modified":"2018-08-13T06:34:15Z","version":323821,"slug":"doodle-jump-demake","name":"Doodle Jump Demake","body":"I and little time and skill but at least I made something ^^\nComments are welcome\n\nFrench people : Checkez le PICO-8 Month, c'est une série de vidéos faite par @Hiinds qui m'a aidé à apprendre les bases de PICO-8\n\nGameplay :  It's obvious xD\n\nSource code : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LyaL3NrARARHWGJnmuK60mV9Gna4RPeY/view?usp=sharing\n\n","meta":{"author":[83230],"link-01":"https://magikh42.itch.io/ludum-dare-doodle-jump-demake","link-01-tag":"42336","link-02-tag":"42336","cover":"///content/e15/41/z/173b2.png"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/doodle-jump-demake","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":1,"notes-timestamp":"2018-08-13T06:25:09Z","grade":{"grade-01":1,"grade-02":1,"grade-04":1,"grade-05":1,"grade-08":1},"magic":{"grade":0.625,"given":1.625,"feedback":0,"smart":27.47548783982,"cool":127.47548783982}},"113091":{"id":113091,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":6106,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-13T06:23:26Z","created":"2018-08-13T05:42:31Z","modified":"2018-08-13T06:23:26Z","version":323780,"slug":"debris-trail","name":"Debris Trail","body":"![debristrail](///content/ad7/1/z/17383.png)\n\n# Debris Trail\n\n## Your spaceship has exploded.

In each round, the player has a turn, then the PC.\nEach time, 3 random numbers are chosen.\nYour aim is to use these 3 numbers, together with the 4 mathematical operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) to claim an unoccupied tile on the board. You **must** use all 3 numbers. \n*Click* on the numbers, and the operators, to cycle through them, before hitting 'Submit'.\n\nHitting 'ESC' will quit the game.\n\nScoring\n=======\nYou score the number on the tile you claim. So, aim high (the CPU will!).\nPRIME numbers are occupied by planets - these all score **50 points**.\nThe winner has the most points after 15 rounds.\n\nExtra tip: BIDMAS\n=================\nYou may remember from your maths class that operations follow BIDMAS rules, ie division and multiplication are performed *before* addition and subtraction (regardless of order). Brackets take overall priority, and you can use the brackets button if you wish. The CPU currently doesn't attempt to use brackets for it's answers.\n\nNote\n====\nTHANK YOU for playing!  I really enjoyed making this one, and will do a blog/post-mortem asap. The CPU AI was a right pain to code, the rest was fairly straightforward. I usually enter the Compo, but circumstances meant I coded on Sunday/Monday, so entered into the Jam. It did make it a bit easier getting sfx and graphics.\n\nDisclaimer: yes, I'm a maths + computing teacher! :smile:","meta":{"author":[10792],"link-01-tag":"42337","cover":"///content/82a/2/z/17fc7.png","link-01":"https://www.dropbox.com/s/p322u25ouckapzm/prime-planets-ld42.zip?dl=0 ","link-02":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DkHn_DcCrsjVZ05xNAZlQ8vNQEGrxdJA/view?usp=sharing","link-02-tag":"42337","link-02-name":"Windows (alternative link)"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/prime-planets","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":0,"magic":{"grade":0,"given":0,"feedback":0,"smart":0,"cool":0}},"113134":{"id":113134,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":19409,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-13T17:49:20Z","created":"2018-08-13T06:35:56Z","modified":"2018-08-13T17:49:20Z","version":327988,"slug":"keeper-of-balance","name":"Keeper of Balance","body":"![title.png](///content/1db/4/z/179ca.png)\n![Gameplay2-red.gif](///content/1db/4/z/17ae4.gif)\n\nPlay at Itch.io: https://cosmicadventuresquad.itch.io/keeper-of-balance\n\n#### ⚖️🌎✨ Summary\n\nYou are the keeper of balance.

Throughout the levels, you must pick up items to open doors and grow back parts of the level that you lost to the void, and avoid cannons! The player's design is Scott Cawthon Inspired. I made this with one of my close friends, William. We made everything in the game from scratch. I did the programming, he did most of the sound effects, and we worked together on level design and pixel art.

The file is relatively large (about 13 MB), but that's due to the FireMonkey framework. If I didn't use it, filesize would be much smaller, but most of the graphical problems would have to be solved using many roundabout ways - in much longer time.\n\nIt's my third game written in Pascal and finished in time for Ludum Dare. The first (2014) was 'Musing About' - a simulation about being a painter in XIX century, created in FreePascal (in Lazarus). In 2015, using the same tools, I've created DEmonsterization (a puzzle game about escaping a dungeon while simultaneously trying to become human again)\n\n# How to play:\n\nEvery level consists of 10 dice scattered on an orange board.\nYour task is to click on a sequence of 3 consecutive numbers in ascending or descending order, for example: 4, 3, 2 or 2, 3, 4. You can't start with the middle number (for example: 3, 4, 2).\nYou'll have to hurry, as the board gets more concealed as times passes, and dice disappear.\nClicking in a die that doesn't fit into the already started sequence (as in 3, 4 and clicking 1) will make the black board cover blink red and the die will remain active and not become a part of the sequence.\nDie that is a part of a sequence turns inactive and won't react to clicking again.\n\nThere can be more than 2 possible sequences among the 10 dice on the board. The higher numbers are in the sequence you choose, the more points. Choosing the highest one also gets bonus points!\n\nIf on a level you didn't manage to find a sequence of 3 numbers in time the game is not over - you'll just get fewer points.\n\nThe game consists of 5 levels, all keeping score - try to get 100% of points available! \n\n![screen04.png](///raw/05d/c/z/17cc3.png)\n\n![screen05.png](///raw/05d/c/z/17cc4.png)","meta":{"author":[52560],"cover":"///content/05d/c/z/17c9b.png","grade-06-out":"1","grade-07-out":"1","grade-08-out":"1","link-01":"https://greenandsubmarine.com/DiceBlackout.exe","link-01-tag":"42337"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/dice-blackout","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":0,"magic":{"cool":93.541434669349,"feedback":0,"given":0.875,"grade":0,"smart":0}},"113884":{"id":113884,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":14824,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-13T18:57:50Z","created":"2018-08-13T18:42:31Z","modified":"2018-08-13T18:57:50Z","version":328792,"slug":"plant-tight","name":"Plant Tight","body":"Hello there!

In this new reality the\ndistinction between humans and machines is so vague that it is no longer possible to \ntell which one are you talking to.\n\nThis game pictures the everyday life of an anonymous inhabitant of this universe in his \nfight to keep his ship running through space a little longer.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\nLife in this solitary space consists in managing your resources correctly. Inhabited planets \nwhere refueling your beaten up ship are hard to find and fuel is a limited resource that is \nrequiered for everything around the spaceship.\n\nBut not only the outside universe limits your range of action. Your trusty ship, that has been\nwith you through the years has very limited instruction memory. Which runs out of space when \nexecuting the smallest of codes.\n\nWith these factors in mind the pilot has to manage to protect his ship from the debris floating \naround space and find new planets to continue his journey.\n\nMECHANICS\n\nThe pilot's task is to give the right orders to keep the ship and himself safe. \nAs good old machine, the ship, requires its orders using a programming language, that prevents \nany possible ambiguity. This language consists of the following rules, that can always be consulted \nby pressing <TAB>:\n\n* shield(s): Activates a shield that protects the ship from impact during s seconds.\n\n* power(m): Turns on motor m (from 0, 1 or 2) Speeds up the ship but increases fuel use.\n\n* goto(x,y): Head the ship to (x,y) coordinates. Locations can be consulted in the minimap.\n\n* fire(): Fire a laser beam that clears the ship sorroundings from asteroids.\n\n* refuel(): While on a planet, it allows refilling the fuel tanks of the ship.\n\nTo enter these commands the ship provides the user with a console terminal where they can be written.\n\nEvery time a program has to be executed, by pressing <ESC> key the code is first compiled \nand executed if everything is correct. But do not worry, because it provides a useful set \nof error messages than can guide you through the most difficult syntax errors and misspellings.\n\nNot everything can be coding orders and the ship provides you with two additional source of \ninformation:\n\n* A minimap: Depicting the closest planets to the ship at any given moment\n\n* A status monitor: Showing the state of the individual parts of the ship along with the motors,\nshield and fuel. \n\nWish you luck in your journey and hope you always find a planet before running out of fuel.\n\n![Screenshot_0.PNG](///raw/7f8/c/z/1815c.png)","meta":{"author":[51447,51943],"cover":"///content/7f8/c/z/1813e.png","link-01-tag":"42337","link-01":"http://goo.gl/oXxE9M","grade-07-out":"1"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/no-mans-space","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":0,"magic":{"cool":0,"feedback":0,"given":0,"grade":0,"smart":0}},"114262":{"id":114262,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":1166,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-13T21:37:45Z","created":"2018-08-13T20:51:43Z","modified":"2018-08-13T21:37:45Z","version":332311,"slug":"space-holiday","name":"Space Holiday","body":"Help an ALIEN fill their LUGGAGE to go on HOLIDAY!","meta":{"author":[1166],"cover":"///content/e84/z/18240.png","grade-06-out":"1","grade-08-out":"1","link-01":"https://bricabrac.itch.io/space-holiday","link-01-tag":"42336","link-01-name":"Play on Itch!"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/42/space-holiday","parents":[1,5,9,97793],"love":0,"notes":0,"magic":{"cool":0,"feedback":0,"given":0,"grade":0,"smart":0}},"114268":{"id":114268,"parent":97793,"superparent":9,"author":102811,"type":"item","subtype":"game","subsubtype":"jam","published":"2018-08-13T21:01:25Z","created":"2018-08-13T20:52:49Z","modified":"2018-08-13T21:01:25Z","version":331221,"slug":"storage","name":"Stor:Age","body":"You need to free up some space on your phone by deleting photos.
